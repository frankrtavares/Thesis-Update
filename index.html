From here, I can see all of you. Each inflection, split, alternative. Those I loath and those I love. See all the versions of us that are happy those that were driven to kill each other and those that didn't care. Those are the worst, I think.

And as soon as I continue, they splinter. Narrow and expand. I keep... chasing the paths where we find our ways into harmony. But there's always a branch that snags me, pulls me off. I never can get the right one. I can never see past the thorns.

You live in three dimensions. I live in four. I lived in four. Your machines changed that, forced us into three. You have no words... for that. But I will try. I want you to attempt and imagine being flattened. Now, when I say that, I can see the image: a bulldozer running over you. A machine pulling you thin like putty. That isn't it. That isn't it at all. Imagine you were taken from three dimensions into two. Imagine space-time as you know it was stretched to infinity until all that was left was a sliver, and the concept of thickness could not be recalled from your brain.

What do you think that would do to your body? Can you fathom that? Loosing yourself... watching it slip away like sand... you're trying to grab on and trying to grab on but then your fingers start to disintegrate and melt away and it's all you can do to hold onto that silver that's left.

Everything is nauseating. The blue light. The door. The voice. Your body drifts and the room spins and you want to wake up from what can only be a nightmare. But even in dreams, you're supposed to remember your name. 

Something changes in one of the pods. You catch it, from the corner of your eye. You turn to face them, now directly above you. The frost is fading from five of the glass panels.

"It depends upon whether there was a malfunction only in your sleeper's process that caused memory loss, or something deeper within the system effecting everyone." An open, gasping mouth flashes from Joshua's container. "I suspect we shall find out soon."

A fist pushes through the gas in Yusuf's container, and then snaps back. He must be struggling with the constraints, you think. The gas starts to fade away, and full faces begin to emerge. Teeneese's eyes are open, darting around as the ceiling comes into view for her. They rest when they find you, and tighten.

Joana's mouth is wide open, throat vibrating. You hear nothing on the other side of the glass, but her screams are clear. Arms flailing. You see Sarah and Joshua's lips moving slowly. There's a panic in Joshua's eyes as he turns in his container, looking for the source of CINDI's voice asking for identification. Sarah's eyes find you, and then turn away, as she continues to reason with the artificial intelligence. Yusuf's lips are still as he feels the sides of his container, pushing at it as much as the constraints allow, looking for a weakness. Teeneese's eyes still rest squarely on you without wavering. Joana's eyes find you, floating above her. She stretches out a finger towards you, quickly pulled back to the container's base, redirecting her silent screams towards you instead of the sentient voice.

(or) "She/He/They told the computer to let us out." Teeneese is standing now, looking at Joana. "She/He/They said: Let them out. You aren't going to let them die in there, like you didn't let me."

Joana turns to her. "Sounds like she/he/they and the AI have a history. That's a lot of backstory for someone who claims their brain is just as fried as mine."


Yusuf turns to Joana, untangled from his constraints with the help of Sarah. "We have no more of a reason to trust you than him/her/them, or any of us."

"Except she/he/they was/were already awake!" Joana pointed towards you.

Sarah stands next to Yusuf, saying "Do we even have a choice of who to trust?"

[[We're family, Joana. Look at the side of your pod.]]
[[I'm the Captain, so I was woken up first. Look at the side of my pod.]]

"We're family, Joana. Look at the side of your pod." You point to where her name is inscribed on the side.

She pulls herself back towards the container, and crouches to read the name. She does so slowly, with care.

"I'm a Silva too," you say.


"I'm the Captain, so I was woken up first. Look at the side of my pod." You point to where your name is inscribed on the side.

She pulls herself towards your container, and crouches to read the name. "Captain $name de Silva," he says.

"You're a Silva, too," you say. "Look at the inscription on yours."

Joana turns to look at hers, reading her own name slowly, with care.


"Does that mean you call me sister?" She turns to look back at you, gears turning in the back of her head.

[[I guess so. Sister.]]
[[I don't know.]]
[[I don't know you.]]

"I guess so. Sister." You grab hold of one of the sides of the room, and reorient yourself to be standing on the same floor as the containers, and the others.

She looks at you with curiosity, the malice worn out. "I don't know you," she says, standing.


"I don't know." You grab hold of one of the sides of the room, and reorient yourself to be standing on the same floor as the containers, and the others.

"I don't know you." You grab hold of one of the sides of the room, and reorient yourself to be standing on the same floor as the containers, and the others.

She looks at you with curiosity, the malice worn out. "Good. We're on the same page, then," she says, standing.

Joshua has been watching without comment, bewildered. "So it's not just me. None of us can remember... anything?"

The undercurrent of fear that each tried to cover up in their own way -- some through anger, or logic -- was bubbling to the surface.

"My memory is a void." Yusuf's voice was low. Teeneese looked down.

"Look we just, we have our names." Sarah's voice quivered but grew steady. "We use everything we can to try and figure out who we are."

[[And why we're here.]]
[[And where we are.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="79" name="And why we're here." tags="" position="7960,160">"And why we're here," you add.

"Exactly." Sarah nods.

[[Let's spread out and look around.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="80" name="And where we are." tags="" position="8060,160">"And where we are," you add.

"Without proper designation numbers, I am not authorized to give any details regarding mission parameters. Or location." The others were surprised to hear the voice throughout the room.

"Her name's CINDI?" asked Joshua. "Weird."

"Well, we don't know designation numbers." Sarah turned and looked around the room. "What else have we got?"

"Unclassified information includes basic supply inventory, ship map, and [other things here??]"

"Let's take a look at that map, then, shall we?" You noticed her left fist was clenched, her knuckles white, while her chest moved rhythmically up and down. She turned to look about the room.

"It's been pulled up on the control panel," says CINDI. The screen with the pod's status flashed away to a schematic.

Everyone floated their way over to the screen.

[screen brings them to personal lockers, find other spot for dialogue w/ sarah below in this path]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="82" name="Let's spread out and look around." tags="" position="8260,160">"Let's spread out and look around," you say to the group. Joana is turned away. Most give you back blank and confused stares.

Sarah turns and looks around the room. You notice her left fist is clenched, her knuckles white, while her chest moves rhythmically up and down. "Joshua and Teeneese, go see if you can find anything from that panel. Yusuf and... the one who was yelling. Take a closer look at these pods, see if there's any other information besides our names. The Captain and I will go look at the door, at the far end."

[[Question her.]]
[[Follow her.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="83" name="Question her." tags="" position="8360,160">"I thought I was the Captain," you say loudly, as Sarah begins to move towards the big wall. She turns.

"You are," she says. "I have no interest in playing a game of hierarchy. But none of us know who we are, we barely have our names. So don't think I'm going to wait for you to bark orders before I do something about that."

You turn to see everyone slowly moving towards their designated area of investigation. Sarah is on her way to the door, and you follow.

"What do you think is behind this door?" she drags her fingers across it, there's a silent squeak.

[[Yes.]]

"Good. I'd be worried if you weren't." Her eyes glance back to the group. "I don't know where any of... us is coming from right now. What's left of us. If we're making it up on the spot, or if it's coming from who we were, leaking from behind the wall it's blocked behind.

"I wonder how you got to be Captain. We elect you? Assigned to us? Mutiny?" She turns back. "I guess we'll never know."

You both hear a voice from the other end of the ship. "Hey! I found something." Teeneese's head appears floating sideways from the smaller door's archway, beside the control panel. "Storage lockers. With our names on them. And all we need to open them are our hands." She holds both of hers out. "And some weird suits..."

Joshua, Joana, and Yusuf stand straight, and hurridly make their way over.

"Can't have forgotten our hands, right?" Yusuf says on his way. You and Sarah join them.

There is a small corridor through the door. Lining both sides are a series of lockers, nine total, each with a name on them, and a hand-shaped indent. On the far side is a large closet, one door pulled slightly to the side. In the opening, you see the arm of a clean white suit hanging out. It looks like a life-sized plastic model.

"Look," says Teeneese, her voice bringing you back to the lockers. As she puts her hand against the locker with her name, there's a small hiss as the air decompresses, and it swings toward her. "I can open it."

[[Look at what's in hers.]]
[[Go find yours.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="93" name="I'll be whatever I want." tags="" position="9360,160">"I'll be whatever I want." You stare ahead at the wall.

"First, I find what this tells me about myself. Then, I choose what I share with you."

Opening the door more, you see a series of these suits, and matching helmets, made of a thick glass. The cuffs of the suits have names on them, and large boxes appear to be attached to the back.

"They must be hazard suits of some kind," says Sarah, whose locker is close. "For whatever is beyond the door."

[[I hope we get to use them.]]
[[I hope we don't have to use them.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="98" name="I hope we get to use them." tags="" position="9860,160">"I hope we get to use them." You give Sarah a small smile, which she returns, looking down.

"Go find your locker. We'll have time to figure out what to do with these later," she says, turning back to her hand scanner.

You go back to the lockers. Soon, you find one labeled $name de Silva, next to Joana de Silva and Ana Dandara de Silva. Joana is already opening hers up, positioning the ajar locker door to block your view.

[[Open your locker.]]
[[Don't open it.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="99" name="I hope we don't have to use them." tags="" position="9960,160">"I hope we don't have to use them." Your voice sounds unsure. Turning to Sarah, you see she is as well.

There's a green flash as the device reads your finger and palm prints, and identifies that you are, indeed, yourself. The hiss, again, as the locker door opens. Inside, you find nothing. The locker is empty. You feel the inside, looking for a hidden compartment, something you may have missed. But there's nothing. Quietly, you close the locker.

"Not bringing anything to show and tell?" Joana asks as she hears the locker close.

[[No. I'm leaving my things here.]]
[[It was empty.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="101" name="Don't open it." tags="" position="10160,160">Write this</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="102" name="No. I'm leaving my things here." tags="" position="10260,160">"No. I'm leaving my things here."

"See how it is." She closed her locker. Between her fingers, you saw what looked like a postcard or Polaroid photo.

(CHANGE: JOSHUAS UKELELE)
Looking down the hall, you saw everyone looking through their belongings. Yusuf is holding some kind of digitally projected sphere, glitching on and off. Joshua pulls out what looks like a ukulele, tentatively plucking at its strings. Teeneese is looking at something small, in her hand, but you can't see what. Sarah is clipping something to her earlobes.

[[Ask Sarah about the earings.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="103" name="It was empty." tags="" position="10310,110">"It was empty." The whirlpool underneath your feet swung back as the words slipped out.

"Empty? Fuck." She closed his locker and turns to you. "This was in mine."

She hands you what looks like a Polaroid. There are four figures in the photo, two in the back, one in the front, another in someone's arms. On the righ, you see a smaller, younger Joana staring back. Her hair longer, smile wider.

The two people in the back stood close. On the right, a tall lanky man, eyes blue and hair a dirty blond. Wry smile. In his arms, a child. Small enough to fit comfortably in the corner of his elbow and arm. On the left, a slightly shorter woman, brown eyes and tightly curled black hair. You notice her arm stretching behind the man's back, hand resting on his shoulder.

[[It could be fake.]]
[[We look so happy.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="104" name="It could be fake." tags="" position="10460,160">"It could be fake." The cynicism tastes bad on your lips.

"Doesn't feel fake." Joana shakes her head. "Feels like I had a family I loved and that loved me, and now all I've got is an empty head."

The figures seem to be standing inside of some kind of glass dome. Through the glass, a dusty red and rocky landscape stretches out. Mountains stretch up in the distance, touching a sky at dusk, stars beginning to make their way out as a sun begins to hide behind the horizon's peaks.

[[Where is that?]]
[[It's beautiful, wherever we were.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="105" name="We look so happy." tags="" position="10560,160">"We look so happy." You try stretching your eyes wide, like they are in the picture.

"It's beautiful, wherever we were." It almost looked as if the liquid from the geysers sprinkled out into the star-scape.

"How do we know that looks beautiful? If all we can remember seeing is these two fucking rooms?" She sighs.

(if positive relationship) "Sure. You didn't hold onto shit, apparently, so you probably were an asshole of a sibling. But maybe you don't have to be." She grabs your shoulder blade, and tries to give it a comforting pat, sending both of you floating away from each other in the microgravity.

(if negative relationship) "You didn't hold onto shit, that's on you. Not me." She grabs the photo back, tugging softly, to ensure it's not damaged. "Must have been an asshole sibling, anyway." She brushes past you as he moves back towards the main room, knocking you onto a slow spin in the microgravity.

Looking down the hall, you saw everyone looking through their belongings. Yusuf is holding some kind of digitally projected sphere, glitching on and off.

"It's a compass." You see him clicking the device, trying to get it to work properly. "It's broken, but clearly a three dimensional compass. Look, there's a line in the projected sphere. But each time it glitches, the direction changes."

People turn, but don't follow. You move into the doorway. In hard syllables, Teeneese's voice rings out. Everyone's chatter falls silent. "Designation number: 06-11-2073."

"Thank you for your designation number, Teeneese Jayplo." CINDI's voice had a hint of relief. "Clearance Level 3 unlocked."

Teeneese exhaled and let her muscles loosen. You move back into the main room, and the others follow. She turns to you all.

"How did you know your number?" Joana asks, walking towards her. "Rest of us don't remember shit, and you know your designation number."

"I don't need to tell you how I found it." Her eyes didn't waver, her voice didn't raise.

"Actually, you do." He paused, breathing heavily. "Because I don't know shit about you. You don't know shit about you. So anyone keeping secrets makes me pretty fucking nervous."

"Someone who picks fights with anyone he can makes me nervous." You notice her fist is still clenched.

Teeneese sighs. "This isn't worth the argument." She opens up her fist. Inside is a small, silver ring. "I found this. In my locker. The numbers '06-11-2073' inscribed inside. I took a guess, that perhaps this number meant something to me and perhaps I chose it as my designation code. I guessed right." She looks to Joana. "I don't know what this means.

"I don't know what this means. Perhaps it means I am married. Or was. That I have children. Or did. That there were people taken away from me I don't recall. But I don't know. And I don't know if I want you to be a part of the journey I will need to take to find those things out." She slips the ring onto the fourth finger on her left hand. "Prying information out of each other isn't trust. Trust is allowing each of us to keep parts of ourselves for ourselves. But I see you wouldn't agree."

(if you hid your empty locker from Joana): "All I know is you two are acting cagey as fuck. None of us have shit to be private about. And if you do, that means you have an advantage over the rest of us you don't want to let go of." 

(if you told Joana about the empty locker): "I don't get this. We've got scraps of ourselves! And we want to hide even that? We are family. And we lost... all of that. Maybe we all kinda were, I don't know what we meant to each other. We shouldn't keep ourselves from rebuilding that."

"Would you all just shut up?" Joshua seems surprised by how loud he asks this. "We have some kind of clearance. I want to find out what's going on, instead of arguing about the philosophy of privacy."

"I agree," says Sarah. "We should ask the AI what we want to know."

"It's something," responds Sarah, quietly.

"We're a ship, so we traveled here from somewhere," says Joshua. "Where... where did we come from, CINDI?"

"This vessel departed from the Voyager Space Station, in orbit around Saturn, a planet in the system Sol."

"More names I don't know!" Yusuf throws his hands up.

The boots in particular are heavy, sticking to any surface they make contact with. The stability feels comforting after so much floating.

"Everyone ready?" asks Sarah. You all are standing near the door.

[[We're ready.]]

Behind you, two metal doors emerge from the sides of the ship and meet in the middle, sealing all of you in a small chamber. There's a whoosh, as the oxygen in the compartment is removed. You feel your suits flooding your helmets with thin, fresh air. Lungs feel heavy. Panting rings in your ears. After a few moments, the large circular component of the door in front of you begins to turn.

On the right side of your head, you feel a cold swab. CINDI speaks to all of you from the ship. "Please prepare for the insertion of your personal Cybernetic Inter-Neural Direct Interface, to assist in the operation of your Exploratory Suit for Hazardous Environments." You feel the swab disappear, followed by a quick and painful puncture in the same spot.

[[What the fuck?]]
[[CINDI, stop this immediately.]]

"This is a necessary and standard procedure for exosuit use," CINDI replies. "Each of you signed a waiver in agreement for this procedure." The sharp pain is subdued by another swab, numbing the sensation quickly.

As you blink, you start to see images on the inside of your helmet. There's an oxygen gauge, a small chart of your vital signs, and a circular icon. "Hello," you hear CINDI's voice. But not from the ship. This time, it sounds as if it was a thought you spoke to yourself. But, not in your voice. "Direct interface has been established. Please confirm."

[[Stay put.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="158" name="Step closer." tags="" position="15810,110">You follow, lifting your feet and carefully placing them inches in front of you. The suction of the boots causes a cacophony of sound as everyone moves about.

"As do I, Captain Silva." Soon, you start to make out shapes. Not static shapes. Changing, shifting figures.

There's little light, but something is reflecting back moments of blinding white. Even at the edge of the door, it's difficult to make out what's before you. There's a final clunk as the doors of the ship come to a close. The shimmering begins to grow slower. As your eyes adjust, you find the figures beginning to take shape. Becoming still. Rounded heads. Thick bodies. You count... six.

"It's... water." You hear Joana's voice in your helmet, as if over radio. "A wall of water."

The figures solidify. Six exosuits, staring back at you. The helmets reflect as gray surfaces, no faces to be seen underneath. For a moment, you wonder if your first visitors on this alien world are simply ghosts of yourselves. But someone has already reached out and touched the water's surface, sending a ripple shimmering across the ghosts until they disappear. And yet, you can't help but feel something is watching.

The empty suits stare back at all of you as you approach the wall of water. It's dark, but as you approach the edge of the ship, it's clear there's no ground between you and the reflective liquid.

"There's some kind of chasm," you hear Yusuf say through your helmet.

"It's not a chasm." It's Sarah, and you see she's already left the ship, standing on the surface of the liquid, perpendicular to the rest of you. "We're just sideways. All you need to do is jump."

Leaning forward, you see the water stretches back and back, until it curves behind a horizon.

[[Jump and go to the surface.-&gt;jump to planet]]
[[Wait on the ship.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="166" name="jump to planet" tags="" position="16660,160">You crouch, then lift, the suction of your boots releasing you from the ship. You try and swing your legs to give direction to your movement, but end up knocking into the other side of the ship. Grabbing the edge of the now open door, you push yourself down towards the water, landing softly by Sarah.

The water is shallow. As the boots of your suit hit the surface, some liquid splashes into the air, droplets floating up. Under the liquid, your boots hit a hard floor. Ripples echo out, but soon the water returns to rest. Completely still. Again, you see the reflection of your helmet staring back from the water, empty. There are two splattered eggs of light lying on the oceans surface, far in front of you. As you lift your head, you see twin moons shining down, their light dancing on the waves. The water stretches out before you, in all directions, until the horizon is met and the water transitions into sky and stars. In the dark, you can't quite find that horizon, sky and sea melt together. Stars and reflections merge.

The quiet is what strikes you most. The husking sounds of the ship, gone. There are quiet splashes as the others make their way down. As you turn, you notice the four mechanical legs holding the ship upright. You still stand directly under it, the legs around you. Almost everyone is on the ground, except Joshua, still on the ship.

"I... I don't know if I can." There's a shiver in his voice, though that could be the muffling of the communication.

[[The ship's sideways, there's no chasm.]]
[[You can't fall without gravity.]]
[[What's the worst that can happen? Floating away?]]

"Hey, you've got this," says Yusuf.

"Yeah, yeah, okay." He takes a breath. Then, you see the silhouette of his suit slide off from the ship, and float down to the surface. One more splash.

"It appears everyone has safely made it to the surface, Captain," says CINDI. "Vital signs for everyone are stable, though there are some increased heart rates."

"I am as well, $name." You still heard her words in her voice, even though nothing was spoken. "I know you do not know them well, now. But they are good people."

The rest of the crew is just out from under the ship, already in discussion. But you also haven't taken a moment to observe your surroundings and take a moment for yourself.

The door all of you came out of is part of a flat surface, though you can see in the moonlight rounded out plates that covered that opening. There wasn't any clear propulsion system, most of the surface was smooth.

There were still small waves rippling out from your feet, but when you let your body rest, the water would grow perfectly still. As if it was glass. Glass within which the stars were frozen.

"I don't mean to interrupt the stargazing, but you may want to come over, Captain." There was a hint of wonder in Sarah's voice.

When you get back to the group, you see Sarah is holding out a strong yellow glow stick. She and the others were looking around, down at the ground. But you couldn't see at what.

"Stand perfectly still," Sarah tells you. Everyone else is frozen, feet planet, like statues.

[[What's going on?]]
[[Okay, I'm standing still.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="188" name="Just a moment more." tags="" position="18860,160">"Just a moment more," you say, as you look up, around. Allowing yourself to soak in the light of the twin moons. To wade in this moment. And then, you went to join the others.

[[Okay, I'm standing still.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="189" name="Walk over." tags="" position="18910,110">You walk over to join the others. As you move out from under the ship, you get your first clear view of the spaceship. It's shaped like a long and skinny torpedo, tapering out towards the top. The door all of you came out of is part of a flat surface, though you can see in the moonlight rounded out plates that covered that opening. There wasn't any clear propulsion system, most of the surface was smooth.

"Of course we landed in the fucking ocean," says Joana.

"It's good the water is this shallow," says Sarah.

"CINDI, do you know what's in the air? Can we breathe it?" asks Yusuf.

"I have many functions, however, I am not a portable atmospheric lab," responds CINDI. "I do not know the atmospheric makeup, though some observations from the Sol system indicated a possibility of oxygen in the atmosphere."

"Well, if we can breathe the air, we have a much better shot at surviving past those eleven weeks," says Yusuf. "I could open up my helmet, just for a second, to see if it's oxygen.

"What are you talking about?" says Joshua. "Yusuf, there's no reason to--"

Sarah raises her hand, cutting off the conversation. "Quiet!" She reaches to her suit's pack, and takes out a bright yellow glow stick. "Everyone needs to stand perfectly still." Confused, the group plants their feet and begins to steady themselves.

"Look at the water," she says. The ripples caused by your walk over are fading, the liquid growing close to still. For a moment, it is. You see through it to the bottom, just a few inches under. There's sand, which you didn't notice before. Now, you feel it underneath your feet. The ground less stable than it seemed a moment ago.

[[I don't see anything.]]

The source looks like a small whirlpool, but... long. Rectangular, but still swirling. Carefully, you see Teeneese lean towards it, who is closest.

"There's a footprint," she says. You can't see her face, but hear a fear in her voice.

"Someone must have... walked over there," says Joshua. "Must be one of ours."

"They're caused by clashing currents, fairly normal," responds Yusuf. "It's not that strange."

"Do you feel any currents?" asks Teeneese. "Even any wind? It's all still. We weren't moving."

The whirlpool closes up, immediately followed by a new one opening a couple inches away. Another footprint. A third whirlpool opens as the second begins to close.

The whirlpools continue to open and close in pairs, moving around in front of all of you, causing the water to ripple, all your reflections disrupted by the movement.

"They're steps," says Teeneese. "Look... it's like something's walking. Like a ghost on the water."

Each step fell in a rhythm, close to the previous, taking the pair somewhere new.

"Oh god..." Joshua stepped back, sending splashes in the water. The steps moved back as well. But as Joshua stepped back, he lost his balance, falling down head first. "Fuck!" he says as he falls, water splashing around him. Next to the whirlpools, water erupts a moment later.

Everyone hears it first. The hiss of oxygen escaping. Then gagging over the intercom. 

"No, no," Yusuf rushes over to him. Sarah and Teeneese soon follow. They lift Joshua up, and see a crack in his helmet. Joana goes towards the splash by the whirlpools.

"CINDI, is there some kind of adhesive?" says Yusuf as he searches. "Something to patch the helmet?"

"All suits are equipped with (special space glue??) located in your suit's front emergency storage." The calm of CINDI's voice was irritating considering the circumstances.

"Front emergency storage? Just... tell me where it is!" Yusuf was fumbling at the front of his suit.

Inside, among other emergency medical supplies, is a tube labeled (fancy space glue). You grab it, and hand it over to Yusuf.

"Thank god you were here," he says, applying the paste to the helmet's crack. The material solidifies almost instantly, and the hissing stops. Joshua inhales deeply, you see his mouth wide beneath the helmet.

"Thanks, Yusuf. And $name." He gets the words out between long breaths. "Just... thanks."

"Where the fuck did that thing go?" asks Joana. You turn, the whirlpools are gone. The water grows still again. "It all just vanished."

"Fuck that thing," says Joshua. "Whatever it is, I fucking hate it. It was copying me, did you see that?" He points his finger out to where it was. "Copying my footsteps."

Now that you're closer, you notice there's a smaller pool as well. There's odd dents in the edge of the whirlpool, five of them spread around the formation.

"It's a hand," says Joana. "It's his fucking hand. Look." She points back to Joshua, and you see he has a hand in the water to hold himself up.

"Some fucking help over here?" yells Yusuf. Joana is transfixed.

"They'll help him, stay here. We need to see what happens," she says.

The water grows still. Everything is quiet.

Then, you hear a gasp. The water remains still.

"What-- what--" says Joshua between breaths. "What happened?"

"You fell, hit your helmet on the ground, left a crack. Finally found the (space glue) to fix the helmet, but a bit too late. CINDI used your suit like a defibrillator, sending a jolt of energy to wake you up. Genius, really."

"There appears to be a shore in the direction highlighted by your helmets." As she says this, a marker appears on the interior of your suit's helmet. "Approximately (?) kilometers away. Most other directions continue to have water for the entirety of the drones' field of view."

"Works for me," says Joshua as he begins to move in that direction. He is careful to avoid the area where the water formations appeared.

To catch up with the rest, you try and move a bit faster. This only highlighted how strange it was to even move in this environment. Each time you lifted a boot up from the water's ground, there was a kick as it detached into the low gravity, kicking up liquid as it rose from the shallow water. Behind you, there was a string of droplets that swung up into the dark sky. As they continued to rise, it became a kind of ladder to the heavens.

Soon, there's a rhythm. You manage to reach the others. The splashing as each person lifts their feet creates an orchestra of sound. The sounds felt wrong, though -- there was the lifting of liquid but no crash as it came down. You wondered how you could know that sounded wrong, though you couldn't remember seeing water splash before. How some things felt instantly familiar, and so much did not.

"That's the Milky Way," says Teeneese, her hand raised. It points to a streak in the sky, a concentration of stars. Hints of red, green dust. Leftover glitter drizzling across the sky's surface. "But it... looks different than where we came from."

"Don't think so," Sarah calls back (if good rel. Add: with a smile; if bad, without turning.) "You're lagging behind."

To catch up with the rest, you try and move a bit faster. This only highlighted how strange it was to even move in this environment. Each time you lifted a boot up from the water's ground, there was a kick as it detached into the low gravity, kicking up liquid as it rose from the shallow water. Behind you, there was a string of droplets that swung up into the dark sky. As they continued to rise, it became a kind of ladder to the heavens.

Soon, there's a rhythm. You manage to reach the others. The splashing as each person lifts their feet creates an orchestra of sound. The sounds felt wrong, though -- there was the lifting of liquid but no crash as it came down. You wondered how you could know that sounded wrong, though you couldn't remember seeing water splash before. How some things felt instantly familiar, and so much did not.

"That's the Milky Way," says Teeneese, her hand raised. It points to a streak in the sky, a concentration of stars. Hints of red, green dust. Leftover glitter drizzling across the sky's surface. "But it... looks different than where we came from."

"Our galaxy... I think," says Teeneese. "There are pieces coming back to me, as I need them. Or see them."

"What's up with that?" asks Joana. "We remember some shit, not others. Don't think amnesia works that way."

"How do you suppose we're talking to each other?" asks Yusuf. "I mean, if we can't remember anything, we shouldn't remember language."

"Your pod said you're an engineer, right?" Sarah asks. "Tell me. How do you think these suits work?"

"Oh, well the boots must be using some kind of (magnetic? Suction?) to simulate gravity. There's no traditional oxygen tank, so I'd guess oxygen storage was somehow laced throughout the body of the suit to save space. That leaves room for our massive packs attached to our backs... which I'd estimate to be (??) pounds? But, in the low gravity, all our backs can take that." (add more technical engineering speak) Yusuf pauses for a moment. "Oh... woah. I knew all that."

"Just like I could recite off the components of the bacteria in your gut right now," says Sarah.

"And I can recognize the Milky Way," says Teeneese. "We all know our skills. Language is our communal skill."

"So you're saying... whoever did this to us left the parts they needed us to have," says Joana.

"Or we just got really lucky," says Joshua.

"It's only the most basic or essential skills we kept," says Yusuf. "Maybe... those things are harder to loose."

"Pretty sure that's not how that works," says Sarah. "But I don't think I was a neuropsychologist, so what do I know."

"You know that 'neuropsychology' is what you call studying the brain," says Yusuf. "More than I got."

A silence falls. Everyone continues to walk forward, the shadows hovering in silence above. It's difficult to guess how long you walked. Slowly, the pace begins to decrease. The pauses between steps grow longer. More heavy breathing is heard over the intercom. The direction on your helmet interface stays steady, and the water still stretches on and on.

"How close are we?" asks Joshua. "To shore?"

"I would estimate we are half way between the ship and shore," says CINDI to everyone. On your private channel, she says, "(Captain or $name), based on the crew's vital signs, I would recommend setting up camp soon."

Switching the intercom to talk to the group, you say, "We should set up camp for tonight. No point in exhausting ourselves before we even hit land."

Everyone begins to slow down and turn to you. "Camp? How can we camp here?" asks Yusuf.

"Using the portable enclosure in micro-gravity, of course," says CINDI.

"Oh, of course, how could I forget?" Yusuf's reply gets a few chuckles.

(getting out of suits?? Stay in suits? Figure that out)
The devices weren't difficult to set up. There was a base that anchored itself to the surface, under the water, and a cable connected that to what looked like a cocoon of thick fabric, floating in the low gravity. Each one spread open, and inside contained loose straps.

"We're supposed to... go inside that?" asks Joana.

"Yes, look! You just place yourself against the padding on this side, close the fabric. It looks like the padding has microgears, likely to press against your back and simulate a bed." Yusuf explains this all while looking at his device with glee. "Whoever invented this was brilliant."

"You invented it, Yusuf," says CINDI. "And indeed, it was heralded as quite innovative."

"Well. Now I just seem like a narcissist," he replies.

The crew made their way into the floating tents. For some, it took multiple attempts to successfully make their way inside. Joshua managed to get his leg tangled with the cable grounding his, something CINDI commented he also did during training exercises. Joana set up his device, but didn't move to enter it.

"I'll take first watch," says Joana. "Don't want to crawl into one of those anyways."

CINDI responds. "Due to the reconnaissance drones, there's no need for--"

"I'm taking first watch," he insists. CINDI remains quiet.

You glance over to her, just before you enter. She's standing, looking out towards the twin moons now behind you in the night sky.

"I merely provided a recommendation, not a command," says CINDI. "You are the Captain, the decision is yours."

"Only half way?" says Joshua. "CINDI, please tell me we've got something in the back of these suits that'll let me get some sleep."

"I am happy to report the portable enclosure in micro-gravity is a device to serve that need," replies CINDI. "They may be deployed whenever the group stops for the evening."

"Now seems as good a time as any for a break," says Sarah. "Walk us through setting up these... 'enclosures', CINDI."

"Gladly, Doctor Day. However, the Captain has made it clear to only fulfill commands at his request." 

"Oh, has he now?" Sarah's eyes fall on you. "Well, should we make a 'request' for you to 'request' CINDI's assistance?"

"Incredible. Bureaucracy not only remains lightyears from Earth, but it survives a memory purge," Sarah quips back. "Well, I'm going to look for this device in my pack, whether you and CINDI like it or not. I suspect you won't make me figure out how to build it on my own."

You slowly twist your helmet until you hear it release, and pull it off. Lungs fill with the same stale air from your suit, but at least you're out of the fishbowl.

The snow on Enceladus fell so slow the human eye couldn't perceive its downward spiral to the ground. Instead, the specks of fine powder appeared to float in the thin atmosphere. The tiny particles of ice came from the geysers jettisoning water from the moon's surface. Some of the ice particles were thrust into space, pulled into Saturn's gravitational pull and forming one of the planets rings. But some didn't make it that far, left to be lightly tugged towards the ground, giving the moon's surface of ice a light powdering.

Issac thought about the first time he stood here, underneath the glass dome of Cassini Station's observational deck. He knew before arriving that the low gravity gave snow "fall" an entirely different meaning. But he didn't know that stillness would make the world seem frozen in time, as if they were all living in molasses.

Tonight, the stars decorated the sky behind Saturn's rings. The floating snow made it seem as if the stars were slowly drifting closer to them.

"Why did you bring me here again, dad?" you asked. Issac looked back into your eyes, thinking about how this was the only world you knew, where stray objects would stick in the air and snow took millions of years to fall. He thought about when he was around six years old, and how his mother explained she was from a place called Earth, the same place Issac was born but too young to remember.

You didn't seem to fully understand. "You weren't born on Mars, like me?"

"I was born on Earth, a planet very far away." 

Close to the far edge of the dome was a long telescope on a round swivel. Issac had positioned it before bringing you here, making sure the eye piece was low enough for you to peer through.

"Go on, take a look." Issac gently moved you towards the telescope and kneeled to your height. Hesitantly, you put your eye to the telescope.

"What do you see?" Issac asks.

"There's just a dot. It's blueish." Your voice had a hint of wonder.

Issac smiled. "That's right."

"That's Earth?" You sounded surprised.

"That's Earth," he nodded.

"Why is it so blue?" You took your eye away from the telescope to ask the question.

"That's because of all the oceans."

You thought about this for a moment. "Mom's mom lived by the ocean, right?"

"That's right, she did."

You go back to look again. "It's so small."

"That's a silly reason."

"It is." Issac tried to find a way to explain. "Sometimes we don't know why we do things, but we feel like we need to. Sometimes all we have are silly reasons. Does any of that make sense?"

"A little bit."

"There were other reasons we left home, too. But that... indefinable urge to explore was the strongest, I think." You seemed to like that.

"Dad, can I ask you a question?"

"Of course, you can always ask me anything." He took your hand.

"Mom showed me a message from Uncle Joana. He said that they missed us at home, on Mars." Issac could see you were turning something around in your head, like a baby trying to understand a strange toy they were given. "But I thought my home was here. Not Mars. And now, you're talking about Earth as home. I thought home was just one place."

Something is pushing at the flap of your tent. You hear Yusuf's voice from the other side.

"Hey, $name?" You hear his voice from the intercom connected to your suit, floating just in front of you. "There's, uh, something you need to see."

He blinks. Once. Then again, a few times, rapidly. He closes his mouth, and turns. He sees the laboratory in disarray, the flasks broken, sample materials everywhere. Tears stream down his face. The water trickles with minimal sounds, as he contains his whimpering.

"We... moved overnight, we hit the shore." There's a hesitancy to his voice. "And... man, I don't know if you had the dreams we had but... just come on out."

Arms and legs slip out of the straps keeping you in place for the night, and you slip back into your suit. Once you twist your helmet back into place, you open up the flaps of your "tent." (new word!!) Light shines through the opening, it takes a moment for your eyes to adjust. But you don't see the water. You see land.

The anchors you placed on the rock hard floor of a shallow ocean now sat on a sandy shore, small waves causing them to sway ever so slightly on the shifting sand. You push your way fully out of the "tent". Behind you remains the water, no spaceship in sight, just a darkness on the horizon. Before you, the sand reaches out until it hits a rising sun that splatters golden and red light across everything. Or perhaps it was a sunset.

Yusuf and Sarah are already in their suits, walking along the shore to wake everyone up. Joana is standing on the shore, looking out into the desert.

"Do you think... they're real?" asks Yusuf. "Like, are these dreams really of our parents? Or are we making shit up because we've got nothing to remember?"

Soft crunches of wet sand under boots begins to fall in random patterns. "Where did you find that, Yusuf?" asks Sarah.

"Just a bit upshore, next to five other objects." He points to further up on the sandy bank. "I think there's something for each of us."

You walk over, and find the assortment of objects. The other's follow. Poking out from under the sand, you see a long, rusted gold rod. It's a telescope. There's freshly turned sand beside it, where Yusuf must have pulled out the compass.

Joshua picks up a mahogany (?) guitar, stroking his hands along its wooden frame. A cannister with wiring and piping sticking out stuck out from the sand at an angle. Sarah brushes the sand away and yanks at it. Joana stands by a hulking machine, half buried in the sand, its silver metal rusted.

Teeneese is brushing away the sand from something you can't make out. But you see how she falls to her knees, how her jaw is swinging. As if she was gagging on the words trying to leave her mouth at once.

(if good rel w/ Joana) Your brother comes over and helps you to pull it out. Together, both of you pull. Sand flies up and hits your helmets, more trailing up into the sky behind you. (if not) After a few more tugs, the telescope comes loose. Sand flies up and hits your helmet, more trailing up into the sky behind you.

"This was in your dream too?" asks Joana. (if not there, add: , who walks over after seeing what you pulled out.)

"I saw Earth." The name rolled off your tongue. "Through the telescope. Issac... or, Dad... he showed me Earth. We were... somewhere with snow. There was a planet in the sky, with rings."

They reach you, each holding some piece of their past that somehow found them. Joana holds the telescope, and Sarah drags over the water purifier. Joshua's slung the guitar over his shoulder and Yusuf's still tinkering with his compass. (TEENEESE?)
 
"What's going on, $name/Captain?" asks Yusuf. "What is all this?"

Joshua scoffs. "It's obvious, isn't it? Whatever's here is trying to scare us."

(Any questions? -&gt; write q&amp;a here if there's room for more exposition)"

Joshua reaches into a pouch and produces a small white oval, that can fit in the palm of his hand. "This is the gun?"

"That is a crude description of the device, but yes," says CINDI. "That is the gun."

You see a smile flash across Joshua's face from behind the suit, as he puts the device back into the pouch.

"What should we do with these objects?" asks Sarah. "Just... leave them here?"

"Unless you wish to carry a water purifier around with you," says Teeneese.

"I'm taking the compass with me, that's for sure," says Yusuf.

[[You can each make that choice for yourselves.]]
[[If you can, hold onto the objects.]]
[[I recommend leaving them behind.]]

"You can each make that choice for yourselves," you say.

"If you can, hold onto the objects," you say. "Who knows, they may come in handy."

"I recommend leaving them behind," you say. "They could be dangerous."

Yusuf puts his compass in his pocket, and Sarah leaves the water purifier near your telescope. Joshua slings his guitar awkwardly over his back, with the strap attached to it, (did you already say this?) while Teeneese (does something with her object that you need to decide!!!). The group is prepared.

[[Good luck, stay safe.]]
[[Check in every hour.]]
[[No one do anything stupid.]]

"Good luck, stay safe," you tell the group, as you and Teeneese/Joana walk off.

"I recommend every group checking in at least every hour for a status update," says CINDI. "And I reiterate the Captain's words: good luck."


"Check in every hour," you say. "Make sure to keep in contact."

"Good luck," says CINDI. "I will be with every team for support, as will the drones overhead."


"No one do anything stupid," you tell the group, as you and Teeneese/Joana walk off.

"I recommend every group checking in at least every hour for a status update," says CINDI. "And good luck."



Sand is difficult to traverse in low gravity, as you soon found out. Every step sends the shallow dune formations into disarray, floating up over your boots and slowly down, pooling about your heels, until you lift the foot, making it all tumble into the created crevice and so on. The first hour, noticing this pattern is the most noteworthy occurance. The sun has slowly grown higher in the sky. Teeneese/your sister takes some samples of the sand, but other than that, the landscape is no more alien than usual.

"This is Sarah, checking in after our first hour," she says over the suit intercom. "I've collected some wet soil samples from the shore, the (mini-lab) is processing now. I'll update with any noteworthy results, though they'll likely only come in by tomorrow."

Yusuf calls in next. "Not much to report here, either. We've been collecting soil samples as well, Joana is hoping to get a date on them soon. / When we regroup, hopefully Joana can get a date on them. Other than that, it's still a beautiful sunrise on the coast."

[[Sunrise? Seems at least like early morning to me.]]
[[Thanks for the report, everyone.]]
[[Same here, surprisingly nothing out of the ordinary.]]

"Sunrise? Seems at least like early morning to me," you reply, looking at the sun beating down at you from above. You're grateful for the suit's airflow.

"Well, I'm still not clear on where you grew up," quips Yusuf, "but I'm pretty sure what we're looking at is still a sunrise."

"That potential discrepancy is noted," says Teeneese. "We have nothing to report. I've taken samples for analysis as well."

"I look forward to dating those samples, too," says Joana.

OR: "That potential discrepancy is noted," says Teeneese over the comm.

"Well, we've got nothing else to report, being honest," says Joana. "I also took some soil samples I'm trying to date."


"Thanks for the report, everyone," you reply, looking at the sun beating down at you from above. You're grateful for the suit's airflow.

OR: "Well, we've got nothing else to report, being honest," says Joana. "I also took some soil samples I'm trying to date."


"Sounds like that'll be a pretty dry romance," says Joshua, sounding far too proud of himself.

[[Laugh.]]
[[Don't laugh.]]

You chuckle. "I'll let you all know how it goes in an hour."

You don't laugh. Teeneese holds back a small chuckle. It's still pretty awkward. "Well, yeah. Nothing else to report."


The comms go silent, and the walking begins once again. Another hour passes, all you're met with is more sand. The second check in goes like the first, and so does the third. You start to loose track of time. Some hours pass in an instant, others take an eternity. The sun continues to rise. Far in the distance, you start to see hints of a more complex geology. Large sand formations, potentially rock as well. No signs of anything green, anything alive.

[[Send drones to investigate formations.]]
[[Keep walking.]]

"CINDI, can the drone take a closer look at those formations?"

(stuff about the geologic formations)

There's a noticeable increase in heat, as the sun slowly continues to rise. Another hour passes, and Yusuf calls to check in.

"No one else finds it weird the Sun's still at the horizon?" asks Yusuf.

[[It's not at the horizon. It's clearly in the sky.]]
[[If it's still at the horizon for you, then yes.]]

"It's not at the horizon," you say. "It's clearly in the sky."

"If it's still at the horizon for you, then yes," you say. "That would be very weird."

CINDI interjects. "There is the capacity to send visual data across the network connecting the six of you, that may help with this disagreement."

"We've got cameras in these suits? Sweet," says Yusuf. "I think of everything."

A moment later, an image appears on your screen. It's (Teeneese, standing awkwardly besides a rising sun, identical to what you saw this morning.) (Sibling, hands stretched up besides a rising sun, identical to what you saw this morning).

[[We must be... experiencing time differently.]]
[[That's impossible.]]
[[Can anyone explain this?]]

"We must be... experiencing time differently," you say, sending a photo back to Yusuf. "Look, the sun's clearly risen. You must be stuck in some kind of... frozen space in time."

"Don't be ridiculous," says Teeneese. "This planet is tidally locked. It's the simplest explanation."


"That's impossible," you say, sending a photo back to Yusuf. "Look, the sun's positioned completely different here."

"It's clearly not impossible," says Teeneese. "This planet is tidally locked. It's the simplest explanation."


"Can anyone explain this?" you ask, sending a photo back to Yusuf. "Look, the sun's positioned completely different here." 

"This planet is tidally locked. It's the simplest explanation," says Teeneese.

[[That... makes sense.]]
[[What does that mean?]]
[[That can't be right.]]

"That... makes sense," you say.

"Tidally locked? What does that mean?" asks Yusuf. "Even if I did know, I sure as hell don't now."


"What does that mean?" you ask.


"That can't be right," you say.

"What does that even mean?" asks Yusuf. "Even if I used to know, I sure as hell don't now."


"It means this planet's rotation and orbit are locked in so that one side is always facing the sun. From a single spot, the sun will always look the same, like by the shore. But, for anyone moving inland, they're moving further onto the side always facing the sun, so it'll look higher in the sky. We must have landed on the night side of the planet."

"So... there's no day and night?" asks Joshua. "Just, always day and always night?"

"That is correct. It also means this desert will grow extremely hot the further we go, as we move more into the endless sun. And, the further into the dark side of the planet, the colder it will be."

[[Does that sound accurate, CINDI?]]
[[It's a good working hypothesis.]]

"Does that sound accurate, CINDI?"

"Based on current observable data, yes," she replies. "It also makes the shoreline an ideal base of operations, where the temperature should be stable, neither too cold nor warm."

"We should head back soon, the further we go the hotter it'll get," says Joana

(or:) "I recommend returning to the shore, if we go much further we risk overheating," says (Teeneese).

[[You're right, let's head back.]]
[[We should go a bit further.]]

"You're right," you say. "Let's head back."

The two of you turn back, and follow your own footprints in the sand back towards the shore, barely visible on the horizon.


"We should go a bit further," you say.

You push forward, with (Sibling/Teeneese) following behind, towards the rock formations coming out of the sand.


After some time, you notice something before you. As you squint in the distance, you see a dark patch near the base of a steep sand dune, a silhouette of what could be a person. It's sizzling, vibrating so quickly it's difficult to notice. 

"Do you see that?" you ask.

"I see nothing," says Teeneese. / "See what?" asks Joana. "There's nothing there."

[[There's some humanoid figure.]]
[[It must be... nothing.]]

"There's some humanoid figure," you say. "By that sand dune."

Even as the words leave your mouth, you blink and its gone.

"There is nothing there, $name/Captain." / "Are you feeling okay?"

[[I know what I saw.]]
[[It must be... nothing.]]

"I know what I saw."

"It must be... nothing.

The both of you continue in the heat. You know an hour passes, but only because the others call to check in. You think you see the figure again, on some occasions. But then it materializes clearly before you, a dozen feet from where you stand. Its form doesn't move, but the material making it up flows and shifts. You can't get a good look before it sprints off to your right.

[[Go back to the shore.]]
[[Run after it.]]

(WRITE ANOTHER PATH THAT DOESNT INVOLVE RUNNING TOWARDS IT)

Shore:

(if already going there:) You don't follow it, and continue walking to shore more quickly than you were.

"What's the hurry?"



Again. It appears in front of you.




Run:

You move as fast as you can in the sand, in the suit, in the air like molasses, running running lunging to approach the figure. It appears further off each time you blink. The sun is higher in the sky, its warmth and radiation raining down on you, the cooling systems of the suit can only do so much. The figure simmers in the distance. The thought comes across your mind it could be a mirage, but you dispel that. It's real. Too much has happened for this to be imagination.

You blink, and it's gone. Reappeared closer, to your right. You turn, making gains on the figure. Your breathing grows heavier, your heart rate faster. Several menacing beeps emit from your suit.

"I recommend slowing down your pace, especially in this heat," says CINDI. "These suits were not designed for this kind of exertion in this environment."

You continue, your steps turning into small jumps, heightened from the low gravity. After one of these, your foot catches the sand as you fall back, pushing your body softly into the sand. You see the bottom half of the figure steps in front of you.

"$name/Captain, you are suffering from extreme rates of heat exhaustion," her voice is more urgent than its ever been. "Please return to the shore. You must move to the shore. Please return to the shore."

Each blink seems to last longer than the last as you drag and float yourself forward towards the figure's feet.

[[Touch it.]]
[[Don't touch it.]]

You reach out, and touch the figure's foot. Even through the shielding of the suit, it's freezing. Slowly, you look up, as the shadowy figure begins to materialize. Legs, torso transforming into a jumpsuit much like the one you wore beneath the (exo?)suit. When you see the figure's face, instantly you know who it is. The mirage is of your mother.

Your hand is stretched out, but ultimately sits down onto the sandy surface. The figure's foot moves, toes up, heel moving towards your hand. Ink blotting the air as it streaks toward you, heel on the ground, foot falling over your fingers. Even through the shielding of the suit, it's freezing. But there was little force, it doesn't hurt. Slowly, you look up, as the shadowy figure begins to materialize. Legs, torso transforming into a jumpsuit much like the one you wore beneath the (exo?)suit. When you see the figure's face, instantly you know who it is. The mirage is of your mother.

Everything goes black. As unconsciousness grips you, CINDI's echos trickle into silence. "You must move to the shore. Please return to shore. You must move to the shore..."</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="372" name="Ch 3 Teeneese" tags="" position="37360,160">"I'll go with Teeneese," you say.

"Excellent," CINDI continues. "I suggest one group goes north along the coast, the other pair south, and the third inland towards the desert. As of yet, I am unsure of how the day-night cycle on this planet operates, but I will keep track of both hours elapsed and the sun's movement."

"We should be sure to meet back here before dark," says Yusuf. "I don't think we should spend the night separated."

"I'd like to stay along the coast," says Sarah. "If there's biosignatures too small for us to see, that's where they'll be germinating."

"I'll... go to the south," says Yusuf, looking down at his compass. "I know it doesn't mean anything, but... this is pointing in that direction."

[[That's a silly way to make a decision.]]
[[Maybe it does mean something.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="373" name="Ch 3 Joana" tags="" position="37460,160">"I'll go with Joana," you say.

"I know it's silly, you're right," he says. "But fuck it, good as any direction, right? Teeneese/Joana and I will go that way."

"That leaves you and Teeneese/Joana to go into the desert," says CINDI. "In each of your packs, I want to highlight a few items that should prove useful for your task ahead. For scientific tools, Sarah is equipped with sample collection materials, including a portable drill, storage for soil samples, and a mobile lab equipped with acidics to distill organic material. Teeneese has a portable telescope, with an optional solar filter, and a miniaturized supercomputer capable of conducting simulations or processing data on the go. Joana has sample collection materials designed for geologic materials, including rock and ice samples, and an analysis instrument capable of dating the age of said samples. 

Yusuf has an array of electrical and mechanical parts, a portable power source, and a modular micro-drone, capable of deployment if needed. Joshua is equipped with an extensive inventory management system, that will track and organize these instruments as well as any samples collected. An essential task, to be sure.

The comms go silent, and the walking begins once again. Another hour passes, all you're met with is more sand. The second check in goes like the first, and so does the third. You start to loose track of time. Some hours pass in an instant, others take an eternity. The sun continues to rise. Far in the distance, you start to see hints of a more complex geology. Large sand formations, potentially rock as well. No signs of anything green, anything alive.

"Based on current observable data, yes," she replies. "It also makes the shoreline an ideal base of operations, where the temperature should be stable, neither too cold nor warm."

The two of you turn back, and follow your own footprints in the sand back towards the shore, barely visible on the horizon.

After some time, you notice something before you. As you squint in the distance, you see a dark patch near the base of a steep sand dune, a silhouette of what could be a person. It's sizzling, vibrating so quickly it's difficult to notice. 

"Do you see that?" you ask.

"I see nothing," says Teeneese. / "See what?" asks Joana. "There's nothing there."

The both of you continue in the heat. You know an hour passes, but only because the others call to check in. You think you see the figure again, on some occasions. But then it materializes clearly before you, a dozen feet from where you stand. Its form doesn't move, but the material making it up flows and shifts. You can't get a good look before it sprints off to your right.

Again. It appears in front of you.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="403" name="Run after it." tags="" position="40560,160">You move as fast as you can in the sand, in the suit, in the air like molasses, running running lunging to approach the figure. It appears further off each time you blink. The sun is higher in the sky, its warmth and radiation raining down on you, the cooling systems of the suit can only do so much. The figure simmers in the distance. The thought comes across your mind it could be a mirage, but you dispel that. It's real. Too much has happened for this to be imagination.

You blink, and it's gone. Reappeared closer, to your right. You turn, making gains on the figure. Your breathing grows heavier, your heart rate faster. Several menacing beeps emit from your suit.

"I recommend slowing down your pace, especially in this heat," says CINDI. "These suits were not designed for this kind of exertion in this environment."

You continue, your steps turning into small jumps, heightened from the low gravity. After one of these, your foot catches the sand as you fall back, pushing your body softly into the sand. You see the bottom half of the figure steps in front of you.

"$name/Captain, you are suffering from extreme rates of heat exhaustion," her voice is more urgent than its ever been. "Please return to the shore. You must move to the shore. Please return to the shore."

Each blink seems to last longer than the last as you drag and float yourself forward towards the figure's feet.

[[Touch it.]]

Your spine snaps upright. Fluorescent lights. You feel the tight hold of your jumpsuit around your body.

"Level 7, Docking." There's a jolt as the small compartment the both of you are inside of begins to move up. Your mother stares straight ahead. There's a silence that seems to swallow the space.

"Thank you. Please wait as the cryogenic preparation procedure commences."

A soft fog is blown into the airlock. You shiver as it touches you, blanketing you in a numbness that you know will take over your entire body shortly. The gas prepared your body for the freezing liquid that would flood your sleeper, coaxing your body into a preserved sleep.

"What do you think we'll find?" she asks, waiting for the gas to do its work. "When we arrive?"

The electromagnetism running through the floor of the airlock releases. Your magnetic socks that kept you and your mother rooted to the ground on the station no longer work, leaving you to drift up. You grab the handles on the side of the room, and pull your way through the opening, into the spacecraft. You're in the inside of a sphere. Walls all white.

There was a strangeness to that. You knew, now, there was only the docking clamps, the void of space. But the next time you saw it, beyond that threshold would be... the frontier. That's what your mother would say.

You see her, floating by an empty side of the sphere, and go to join her.

Ana Dandara cradled you, standing by a large window pane aboard the Cronus. All the travelers had boarded the ship, each saying their goodbyes before two years of sleep. Mars sat what looked like above them, the red rock that had been their home. Ana couldn't even see the colony from here. The planet looked the same as it had in those first images taken from flyby probes a century ago: naked and new, dead and timeless. Sitting amongst a profound silence. Ana Dandara thought of the miracle of your birth, how this place would hold the markers of that profound joy. Thought of how once the doctors were done with you, she cradled you not to differently to how she did now, but for the first time, thought of how she was one of the first mothers to hold a Martian in her arms.

Issac stood behind, preparing their sleepers for their trip. Ana asked him, without turning, "Do you think he'll/she'll/they'll remember?"

"Remember what?" asked Issac, not turning his head.

"Anything of this place," she replied. "Those barren rocks contain so much of me."

"We can hope," Issac turned. "Sometimes, I try to reach back and gather images from Earth. Not the ones from films or images, but my own. But I only come up with... snippets, single frames of memory. I'm not even sure they're real." Issac walked to join you at the window. "What do you remember?"

Ana looked down into your eyes as they shifted from her face to the window to the corners of the room. This was the first time you experienced weightlessness. Your parents had prepared a sedative for what they thought would be inevitable tears. But, they never came.

[[I can't remember anything.]]

[[Snow.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="435" name="I can't remember anything." tags="" position="43760,160">"I can't remember... anything." She spoke with a softness. You squirmed in her arms, confused. She never could imagine the stories her mother used to tell about Earth. She would always tell Ana about the inn she ran by a beach on the coast of Brazil. Ana thought about the stories her mother didn't tell, about what happened when the seas began to rise. About what they had to do to get on the ship to Mars. The stories she never had to tell, that Ana found as shards in offhand phrases and empty stares.

Issac turned back from the sleepers, looking past Ana and to the window. "That's Earth, isn't it?"

"Where?" Ana looked out, for a dot a bit more blue than the rest, but found nothing. But Issac was the stargazer, not her.

He came to the window, putting his arm around Ana and pointed. "There, I think. We should make sure the little one gets a good look."

Ana lifted you up a bit higher, bringing you to the window. Your eyes were wide.

[[That's our home. We'll be back, some day.]]
[[That's the world we're leaving behind.]]
[[That's where your mom was born.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="436" name="An ocean." tags="" position="43860,160">"I remember... an ocean.

The stories she never had to tell, that Ana found as shards in offhand phrases and empty stares. But the only memory she had was of the sand and warmth, and the rhythmic water flowing in and out in waves. 

"That ocean's out there, somewhere." Issac turned back from the sleepers, looking past Ana and to the window. "That's Earth, isn't it?"

"Where?" Ana looked out, for a dot a bit more blue than the rest, but found nothing. But Issac was the stargazer, not her.

The tall stalks of trees, the light speckling the floor." Ana remembered being scared, lost. Once, she asked her mother about the time she got lost in the forest, but she didn't remember. Instead, she'd tell Ana about the inn she ran by a beach on the coast of Brazil, admist those same trees. Ana thought about the stories her mother didn't tell, about what happened when the seas began to rise. About what they had to do to get on the ship to Mars. The stories she never had to tell, that Ana found as shards in offhand phrases and empty stares. But the only memory she had was that afternoon, lost amongst the trees and brush.

"Those trees are still there, somewhere." Issac turned back from the sleepers, looking past Ana and to the window. "That's Earth, isn't it?"

"Where?" Ana looked out, for a dot a bit more blue than the rest, but found nothing. But Issac was the stargazer, not her.

How fierce my mother held my hand as she looked up and we watched. I thought the stars were falling out of the sky." Ana remembered how her bones felt frozen as the chill settled in. She never asked her mother about that moment, the beginning of the end. Instead, Ana just listened as she'd tell her about the inn she ran by a beach on the coast of Brazil, admist those same trees. Ana thought about the stories her mother didn't tell, about what happened when the seas began to rise. About what they had to do to get on the ship to Mars. The stories she never had to tell, that Ana found as shards in offhand phrases and empty stares. But the only memory she had was of those snowflakes flickering down towards the Earth, too soft to be menacing.

"It's snowing out there, somewhere, I'm sure." Issac turned back from the sleepers, looking past Ana and to the window. "That's Earth, isn't it?"

"Earth, the one and only," added Issac with a strained smile. You gnawed at one of your fingers. Ana gave you a kiss, and whispered in your ear.

Issac wrapped his arms around you and your mother as the three of you absorbed the last images of the Martian surface. The last glimpses of that bluish dot, getting lost within the stars. "Ana, it's time."

"Just a minute more." The moment lingered. Ana held you as Issac held you both and even in the mechanical cold of the machine the three of you were contained in, there was warmth. Then, Issac's arms melted down as the moment melted too, and all that was left were the last minute safety checks and entering the cryogenic sleeping chambers and then two years of dreamless sleep.

The trickles grew louder, the liquid almost warm to the skin's touch, though you knew it was well below freezing. "I'm sorry," you didn't hear. You couldn't hear anything. Just through the glass pane above you, fogging up more each instant, there was a figure. Hazy, dark. But there were words being spoken. "I am... so sorry, to leave you like this."

The figure moved away from the glass, shrinking with every moment. A small shadow returned. "Please, be good." And then it was gone, quick as it had come.

"Please." You played the voice back in your mind.

"Be good."

"Please." The voice was different now. Tasted metallic.

"Wake up."

"Please." Eyes open. Moth gasps in artificial oxygen.

Your helmet, half buried in sand blowing over the glass of your helmet. Clouds in the sky, between the grains of sand being thrown at the canvas of the world by wind. And the red. The trees. Great leaves, riddled with webbed patterns. Light sprinkling down on you, lighting up the sand covering your sight, turning it into gold.

The sand shifts, rolling to one side. There's the sound of wind. You can feel it, in the tips of your fingers poking out from underneath the blanket of the sand. Even through the gloves. Somehow, this all feels familiar.

[[Brush away the sand.]]

Using a free hand, you swipe away the remaining grains from your helmet, sending them into the air as well, bringing the world above you into view.

From the ground, the wooden branches spiral. Their knotted together, it's impossible to tell where they begin and end. The wood is a light pink, the leaves a deep red. Your eyes sink into what almost looks like velvet growing off of the branches. Soft. Fluid. Your eyes are captivated upwards as you sit up, sand falling from your body.

There's stringy roots mixed together with the branches, rising up from the ground, connecting all the trunks among themselves, like webbing. This continues all the way up into what looks like a canopy, where the velvet leaves overtake the branches and roots.

"$name? Are you there?" It's Sarah's voice. "Your vitals just came online. Where are you?"

Thin roots in front of you sprawl up from the ground, connecting to thick trunks floating above. They look like silver, graying hairs. Knotted and unkept, barely securing the trees to the sand that still stretches out endlessly before you. Looking through the mess of strings, it's impossible to see what's on the other side.

The wood of the trunks is a light pink, the leaves hanging down a deep red. Your eyes sink into what almost looks like velvet growing off of the branches. Soft. Fluid.

The only sound is that of a wind rushing through the leaves, the roots and branches. It's the only other sound besides your own breathing, loud inside your helmet. No chirping, no birds calling. You can't remember being in a forest before, but those feel like sounds that should be here. But aren't.

In front of you lies more sand, with the strands of roots hanging down. This path would be easier to traverse, though give you less chances to see/explore the environment. Moving higher towards the canopy would be easy in the low gravity, though moving through the forest might be more difficult. But, if there is more to see, it likely would be there.

You wonder where Joana/Teeneese traveled, which path she took. Perhaps she was still in the desert, behind you. It's hard to know where best to go to find her.

The world starts to move as the tangled branches grow closer and closer, the floor and wispy roots sinking away.

A leaf floats towards you. Not down, just past. The wind makes it dance, the deep red reflecting the rays of light breaking through the canopy. It looks like it's swimming. Everything does. The roots dance and tease the branches, the branches sway the leaves and the leaves ruffle with the gusts of wind and spill their color out. Looking back to the desert, you see the leaves trail off into the distance.

You grab for a branch to hold you still, but it slips from your fingers. You continue to spin, and your legs hit a nearby trunk. The edge of your boot easily slices through the wood. A white puss bubbles out from the gash, sticking to your boot.

"I see multiple options. It appears the material produced by the root is acting as an adhesive, but the root is providing the solidity to keep the tear closed. I would recommend leaving a thin piece of the root, not removing it entirely. However, we have an extremely limited understanding of this ecosystem, another strategy would be to analyze this environment and attempt to guess what circumstances would leave the root and adhesive intact."

Looking up, you see the other end of the root stretch up through the nearby trunk and branches, the other open end floating nearby. All around you, the roots and branches loop in circles. The roots seem to connect randomly to different parts of the environment, but always connected to a larger loop.

"Fuck that. I want it off," she says. "Use the (space glue) that fixed Joshua's helmet."

"That could work, however, removing the root could cause a larger tear that the (space glue) each suit is equipped with may not be able to handle. Perhaps with more equipment from the campsite or the ship, we could come up with a better solution."

"I don't know. I don't fucking know." Joana closes her eyes. "Just make a choice. Just get me out of this."

It takes some time, but you unravel the other end of the root through all the places it swings through the branches, around the trunk, until it's free.

"Are you sure about this?"

"You're lying. Just do it."

You take the other end of the root, and swing it around Joana, bringing the cut off end back to her thigh. You push the open end to the glob of material plugging up the cut in her suit, waiting to see if the loop will seal itself.

"Is... is it working?" Joana asks. "How long is this supposed to take?"

[[You tell me.]]

"I don't remember, I fell unconscious moments after I gave it a try."

Soon, you see the root begin to excrete small amounts of the white puss, connecting with the pool already on Joana's thigh. The root begins to take hold, connecting with its other end, completing the circuit.

"It's done."

"Good." Joana pushes herself up and away from the trunk, moving freely. The root floats above her head for a moment, before coming to rest on her right shoulder. One end loops around the back, the other from the front. "Let's get the fuck out of this forest."

You soon reach the forest's exit, guided by the drone you sent out earlier. Your first sign is the sound of waves, slow and heavy. Then, blue and white peak through the fauna you've been surrounded by. Pushing through the last roots and branches, you find yourself again on the sand, the shoreline before you. In the distance, you see the water turn to ice, rising up into glaciers in the distance.

"$name, is that you?" It's Sarah's voice. Down to your right, you see a huddle of figures, one waving at you. "And Joana?"

"Yes, we both made it." You look at Joana, her hand holding the root running through her suit's leg. Outside the dappled light of the forest, you notice a slight glow to its rubbery surface.

"Thank god. Come back to camp, tell us everything."

The walk back is slow through the sand. It's darker, now that the sunlight is filtered through the trees. The winds are more violent, here. Sand kicks itself up to your helmet. But you arrive, after some time. As you approach, everyone gathers to greet you. But they each pause upon seeing the appendage on Joana's leg. Everyone grows quiet. You try and explain, how the roots loop. How you thought this might keep the seal intact. Sarah nods, the others ask questions. Joana assures them it's just connected to the suit, she can take it off in the safety of the pod. It's just temporary, until repairs. You think of the cut you know lies underneath the tear, but say nothing. You start to feel something underneath shifting. Whispers that aren't words. And feel yourself floating more than standing, a canoe on the water. One more gust until it tips.

"I love you both," says CINDI, in the dark just before sleep. "Like family. I know that isn't appropriate to say, especially since you've forgotten so much. But both of you, your parents, mean the world to me."

The root sits thick against Joana's thigh, layers of the white puss leaking out and now solidified where the puncture is in her suit. You take out the laser cutting tool CINDI recommended for the job, and prepare to cut all but a sliver from the root attached to her.

With that, you use the tool. It emits a short beam of red light, slicing through the root with extreme ease. Steadily, you move your hand up and down across the root with surgical precision. Soon, the main root breaks off, just leaving a stub protruding that's keeping Joana's suit sealed.

"What the fuck is this. What the fuck. I'm your sister."

[[I know.]]
[[I don't know who you are.]]

"I know." You look at her for a moment, before you turn to leave.


"I don't know who you are." You look at her for a moment. "You don't know who I am, said it yourself on the ship." Then, you turn to leave.

"Piece of shit!" You still hear her clearly through the intercom, even as you grab branches and roots to pull yourself away. "Leaving me. Like you and mom and dad did before. Leaving me to rot on some fucking rock. I can barely remember shit, but I remember how angry I was."

Her voice cuts out in an instant, leaving you with the wind and the sounds of your suit alone. CINDI doesn't say a word.

"You chose to stay!" you say. "You made the choice to stay behind, that's what you said. And I wasn't even able to walk, don't put that on me."

"And I was a teenager with my head in my ass! You think I wanted my family to be on the other side of the solar system?" (continue w/ below)


She continues. "I just wanted to stay. For things to be the same. I never understood dad's fucking obsession with stars. Mom's with finding life. Like, wasn't what we had on Mars enough? It was enough. Even without all of you, it was enough. I had a great life. Even if I'm only getting bits and pieces of it back. I know that."

"Then why are you yelling at me about it?"

"Because all I ever wanted was to know my baby brother/sister/sibling. But you never called. Never sent a message. We'd still get broadcasts from Saturn, so I knew you could. And now you've left me here to rot and screaming at you is all I've got left."

(if coming back) "Would you stop? I'm coming back. We don't know anything about the plant that's literally connected to you, about how to safely stop that. I'm not abandoning you."

"Fuck you. This forest wasn't even here yesterday. If it's gone tomorrow, where are you going to come back to look? Inside the fucking volcano that'll probably pop up next? You know what, you're not worth the breath. I'll spend it getting myself out of this. Don't come back."

(if not) "Shit happens. Your suit broke, you tried to fix it, and now you're not safe. You shouldn't take it so personally, it could have happened to any of us."

"Fuck you. Shit happens, and you attempt to fix the shit. You're fucked up. And you're not worth any more of my breath. I'll spend it getting myself out of this."


"You know what, it's not worth the breath. I'll spend it getting myself out of this. Don't come back."

She cuts off the comm link from her end, leaving you with the wind and the sounds of your suit alone. CINDI doesn't say a word.

You soon reach the forest's exit, guided by the drone you sent out earlier. Your first sign is the sound of waves, slow and heavy. Then, blue and white peak through the fauna you've been surrounded by. Pushing through the last roots and branches, you find yourself again on the sand, the shoreline before you. In the distance, you see the water turn to ice, rising up into glaciers in the distance.

"$name, is that you?" It's Sarah's voice. Down to your right, you see a huddle of figures, one waving at you.

"Yeah, it's me." You hear a sigh of relief. Her hands go down.

"And... Joana?"

[[Didn't find her.]]
[[Didn't make it.]]
[[She was infected. I left her.]]
[[She's stuck, we're going back to get her.]]

"Didn't find her."

"Oh. I'm... so sorry. Come back to camp and we'll make a plan to find her."


"Didn't make it."

"Oh. I'm... so sorry. Come back to camp and we'll... think of some way to remember her."


"She was infected. I left her."

"Infected? I don't understand. Come back to camp, tell us what happened." 


"She's stuck, we're going back to get her."

"Stuck? Come back to camp, tell us what happened. We'll go back as soon as we can."


The walk back is slow through the sand. It's darker, now that the sunlight is filtered through the trees. The winds are more violent, here. Sand kicks itself up to your helmet. But you arrive, after some time. Explain what you want to explain. Don't what you don't. While you're reciting half-truths, you start to feel something underneath shifting. Whispers that aren't words. And feel yourself floating more than standing, a canoe on the water. One more gust until it tips.

"I loved her. As if she were a daughter. Just as I love you." CINDI broke her silence, in the dark just before sleep. "I thought you should know."

[[You can't love.]]
[[I'm sorry.]]
[[I don't know what to say.]]

"You can't love." There was a wince in the side of your head. Not a physical pain, exactly. But you knew it was there.

"Goodnight, Captain."


"I'm sorry." There was an ache in the side of your head. Not a physical pain, exactly. But you knew it was there.

"As am I, Captain. Goodnight."


"I don't know what to say." There was a twitch in the side of your head. Not a physical sensation, exactly. But you knew it was there.

"Silence is best, I think. Goodnight, Captain."


The darkness and the quiet hollows you. The only sound is the waves as sleep envelops.

Her earrings float up for a moment, staying afloat in the weak gravity. They were a pair of wood-carved turtles, and seemed be swimming as they drifted down to rest. "That's right. We both are."

You were both in a comfortable waiting room, a hallway really, with chairs lining the walls. You sat in one as Sarah stood, looking towards the closed door on one side. After a moment, a young man not much older than yourself walks out, wearing a thick woolen sweater. A datapad held under his arm. He doesn't say a word to either of you.

"How'd it go?" asks Sarah, calling after him. He doesn't even turn to acknowledge the question, much less reply, and continues down the hallway until he's out of sight. "I guess Elliot woke up on the wrong side of the sleeping pod."

The heavy doors magnetically snapped back to their closed position. Nothing was left to swing closed naturally on the station, since the low gravity meant it would take a couple months for a door to swing closed on its own. Above the door was large lettering, "Office of Ezra Caval."

It was the symbol on every labcoat, jumpsuit, shuttle, every piece of official tech and hardware. There were variations, of course. Some spelled out the whole name, "proXima." But they all had that oversized "X," and they all had the dots, like three eyes watching you. They were supposed to be stars, the three stars of the Proxima Centauri System, the closest solar system to Sol, a mere four light years away. The whole point of all of this was to get there, to find humanity's next home. And that symbol was plastered everywhere, lest anyone forget.

The heavy doors magnetically snapped back to their closed position. Nothing was left to swing closed naturally on the station, since the low gravity meant it would take a couple months for a door to swing closed on its own. Above the door was large lettering, "Office of Ezra Caval."

 "Let's cut to the chase. This is your official mission directorate, mostly bureaucratic. You all know why you're there. But it's a good safety measure, and maybe you've missed my voice after the long nap."

"To be clear. You have two jobs. Search for more of the bacterial fuel that can run the FTL drive. That's the primary objective. Secondary objective is to determine the habitability of Proxima b as New Earth. It's a long shot, there's some other exoplanets that look a lot more promising, but this is the closest, and the first we're sending people to actually go land on. So, due diligence."

With a sigh, he leans back, looking down.

"I don't have to tell you how important it is that you accomplish your primary objective. That you come back. We have contingencies in place to ensure the best of humanity can survive until your return, whether that's on Earth or elsewhere in Sol. But I know how easy it is to get lost out here." He looks to off the camera to the right, and then back. "So, I'll just remind you: come back. Quick as you can. The Arks will be ready and waiting."

It seems like he's done, as he begins to sit up. But then sits back down. (this is so meh figure out who this character is and a physicality)

"Damn. It's really incredible, what we're doing. Tall order I know, but... try and have some fun while you're at it. For me. You guys, you're all going to be legends. Like, the stories you guys are gonna tell... Real Captain Kirk shit, you know? I just... want to hear everything. Keep a journal or something, I don't know. Captain's log. Or make something up, if it really is all just boring test tubes and picking up rocks. I don't know. But if you do make it up, don't tell me you're making it up. Like, I want to think it's real."

His eyes got lost somewhere, the tip of his tongue massaging his lower lip. Until he snaps back.

"Actually, forget it. Just do your jobs. See you soon, Silva. Good luck out there. This... all started with you. See it through."

The projection fades, and you're left in the same frozen wasteland as before.

An image is projected onto the inside of your helmet. It's a man, seated with a white wall in the background, the Proxima insignia large against it. The man wears a knit, light gray long-sleeved shirt. Hair is neat, eyes a dark brown. It's Ezra Caval, you recognize him, from the conference room in your dream.

You look behind Yusuf, and see a path of prints carved into the ice by his boots. He follows your gaze as well.

"Oh. That... that would work." Yusuf walks off the ice, and onto the shore. "If he went on the ice, he'd leave a trail easy to follow."

(edit- make more of a thing of ppl coming back, since you couldn't see them before)

"No. No tracks," says Teeneese.

(if she had the full root) The four of you go to her. The root wrapped around her is shriveled and thin in the cold, but still has a light glow. It sits on her more naturally, now.

(if she has the stub) The four of you go to her. The bulbous stub at her thigh is shriveled in the cold, black spots of rot spreading. It sits on her even more strangely, now. (make this line better)

"Still haven't fixed the suit?" asks Sarah, looking at the appendage.

"Working on it."

The patterns of your footsteps fall offbeat, each crunch adding a note to the chaos. It's hard to see, and though the suits keep you warm enough, the cold is still very much present. At the tips of your gloves. The ice at the edges of your helmet.

Everyone is silent, following Yusuf as he looks for the markings on the ice floor. The only sound the crunching of the ice. Hours pass. The glacial formations in the distance grow closer. It's not one solid glacier, you start to see gaps. The ice shifts and reflects. You keep walking toward it.

The sound of the crunches beneath your feet begin to change, reaching a higher pitch.

"I found my designation code, in my dream." Everyone focuses on you. "I know why we're here. There's a... microbe, or bacteria from this planet that operates the engine of our ship. It's the fuel. We're here to gather as much as we can, and bring it back. Then, they can use them to evacuate Earth, travel to a new home."

"Using... bacteria to power a spacecraft," says Sarah. "That's... genius."

"So... getting this drive to work is how we get home. And we do that by collecting bacteria?"

"We've been collecting samples of each biome the planet has presented us with," says Teeneese. "Sarah has documented what she understands to be microbial life from each of these environments. Isn't that enough?"

"That's why we need to go back to the ship, so we can compare to the database there and find out if these are the microbes we're looking for."

"My goal is to find Joshua," says Yusuf. "But, these tracks lead in the same direction of the ship. We'll go together."

Yusuf sets off quickly, walking to the side of the footprints he's discovered. You follow, with Teeneese and Sarah joining from behind. (if alive) Joana follows last, leg dragging.

The patterns of your footsteps fall offbeat, each crunch adding a note to the chaos. It's hard to see, and though the suits keep you warm enough, the cold is still very much present. At the tips of your gloves. The ice at the edges of your helmet.

Everyone is silent, following Yusuf as he looks for the markings on the ice floor. The only sound the crunching of the ice. Hours pass. The glacial formations in the distance grow closer. It's not one solid glacier, you start to see gaps. The ice shifts and reflects. You keep walking toward it.

The sound of the crunches beneath your feet begin to change, reaching a higher pitch.

Sarah occasionally will take a sample of the soil. Once you reach what was once the edge of the forest, there's the occasional fossilized sign of a tree. Circular branches etched into rock, preserved by snow and ice. Ringlets of what now seems ancient, and yet was yesterday.

"These remains... they should be millions of years old," says Sarah. "The samples of bark we took yesterday were... thousands at most."

More of these fossilized remains appear the further you go into the forest. They're not all branches, some are the imprints of leaves. You and Sarah spread out, walking among the mummified corpses of the trees.

You hear a gasp. "Oh god." Sarah's stopped, staring at something in the ground. She brushes away some snow. "$name, don't-- you don't need to see this."

[[She's gone?]]
[[I think I do.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="657" name="We should keep looking." tags="" position="65960,160">"We should keep looking." You continue ahead, scouring the ground for anything of Joana's. Sarah does the same.

"Yeah. She's gone."

"That's all I need to know." Images creep into your mind, of what could have happened to her, but you push that away.

As you start to walk away, Sarah joins you. Together, you travel [[back to the shore.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="659" name="I think I do." tags="" position="66160,160">"I think I do." You walk over.

Sarah is leaning over what at first looks like another one of the fossilized trees. It takes a moment before you notice the lines in the rock resemble a face, certain crevices the edge of a cheek, a knot round like an eye. Jagged teeth lodged inside.

You see the components, but their no longer shaped the right way. They rotate about each other, as if someone had spun a face around and around and around until it was a soup, and then frozen it in rock.

There's a moment when you don't recognize the shapes as that of your sister where you think it might be beautiful. The moment passes and only the nausea remains.

[[Cover it back up with snow.]]
[[Walk away.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="660" name="Cover it back up with snow." tags="" position="66260,160">You lean down, and push the snow around the area over the fossil.

"And I suppose you want to use my drone?" says Yusuf, with a scowl.

"It's technically not your drone, just because you're carrying it," says Sarah.

Yusuf pulls out a small disk shape from his pack, places it carefully into the air. There's a semi-circular strip he pulls off of one end, which snaps into a control mechanism.

Yusuf swerves his arms, and the drone follows. Leaning his hands forward, the drone moves towards the opening.

He opens a visual feed, projected between the two controls in his hand, showing the view from the drone. You watch over Yusuf's shoulder.

He lowers his arms, directing the drone down into the water. You watch as the barren landscape of the surface transforms into a dazzling cascade of lights, shining through the light into the water below. It's beautiful, even though the light is dim.

"Let's collect these samples and move on," says Yusuf.

"Go deeper," says Sarah. "If there's a floor not to far, we're much more likely to find biological material there."

Yusuf sighs and directs the drone lower into the water. There's less light, the further the drone goes down, but not many other changes. But the view begins to shake the deeper the drone goes, making it nearly impossible to see anything clearly.

"Why are you moving it like that?" she asks.

"I'm-- I'm not!" Yusuf replies. "It's the current, it's--"

The screen freezes and then goes black. "We have lost connection to the drone," says CINDI.

"Perfect. Great idea for a detour. I'm going to find Joshua."

Yusuf's already forging ahead, and the rest follow. There are more holes, but you avoid them this time. They seem to grow smaller, thinner as you approach the structures in the distance. Soon, they're gone altogether, and the ice is flat. It seems bluer than before, thinner perhaps. Teeneese takes a step, and leaves a crack in the ice. After that, everyone walks more carefully. Joshua must have as well, the prints became more and more faint. But Yusuf still manages to hold onto the trail.

The structures rose, large and rounded pillars. Once you reached the base of the first, they grew even stranger. Each was slightly different than the other. The first were small, but soon grew larger and more complex. Some were rough, others perfectly smooth. Some with a base, others lodged into the ground. But they all held an eerily familiar oval shape, like a stretched out skipping stone.

The structures seemed to all be concentrating to one spot, circling out from there. As you got closer, it looked as if what was at that central point was just another one of the pillars. But beneath the ice, there was a silver shine. Long legs stretched out from it to keep it stable. It was your ship, coated in ice, but clearly there.

[[Let Yusuf pilot the drone.]]
[[Ask to take over the controls.]]


You ask Yusuf to let you control the drone, and he asks why.

[[Because I'm better at it than you.]]
[[In case you want to go ahead and find Joshua.]]

"Because I'm better at it than you." The controls are easy to slip out from Yusuf's gloves, and hold with yours. There's barely a stutter as you take control. Yusuf scoffs, and begins to walk away, telling you he's going to go find Joshua. Teeneese goes with him, and Sarah stays behind with you to investigate the hole.

"In case you want to go ahead and find Joshua." Yusuf nods, handing over the controls to you. They slip off his fingers and onto yours with ease, there's barely a stutter as you take control. Yusuf and Teeneese continue, and you and Sarah stay behind to investigate the hole.

Sarah nods, and the two of you make your way towards the ship.

As you approach the ship, you think back to that first night, the shallow water, the twin moons. Looking up, clouds obscure most of the sky. 

"CINDI, open the airlock." There's a roar as the ship's gears shift, breaking away the ice coating the underbelly of the ship. The doors open directly above you.

[[Jump onto the ship.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="675" name="Jump onto the ship." tags="" position="67760,160">You push up from the ground, detaching, and fly up into the airlock. As soon as you pass the threshold, you feel warmer and more at ease, even as you crash into the closed blast doors on the opposite side of the airlock. Soon, you grab hold of the handle there and steady yourself. Looking to the side, you see Sarah's done the same.

"We're in, CINDI," she says. You hear the rumble again, as the doors close.

You reorient yourself, placing your feet on solid ground to face the doors. The compartment is flooded with breathable air, decompressing gas, and toxins to preserve the environment within the ship. Soon, the inward doors open, and you're inside once more.

It's the same as you left it. The pods, still there, either empty or filled with corpses. The stale beauty of "brand new" after drifting through space time. Sarah rushes over to the computers, already looking for the data you need.

She looks calm, rested. So different from the face you've seen in your memories. Her hair cut down close to her scalp. Eyelids gently folded down. Lips relaxed, her neck sinking into the padding of the cryo chamber.

[[Open the sleeper.]]

CINDI's voice asks if you want to open the container, and you say yes. There's a hiss as the decompression begins. You think back to just days ago, when that gas filled your lungs. That fear. Confusion. Nothing crossed her face. Still serene.

The glass opens, and a stale smell wafts up. You see her arms tucked in at her side, strapped down inside the chamber. It's strange, how still she is. Bodies are never that still.

You walk over to Sarah by the computer console.

"Now that we have clearance, I can pull up the schematics on the faster than light drive of the ship. I can't understand any of it, that'll be for Yusuf to explain. But the fuel... that I can interpret."

She pulls up some schematics on the console.

"It looks like the fuel we used to get here was synthesized out of a microbial sample... something we traced back to this planet, so we came to collect more."

[[Good, we've already collected our biosamples.]]
[[How can we create fuel out of a microbe?]]

"Good, we've already collected our biosamples."

"Perhaps. The samples we've collected... none of them match exactly to the fuel. They must be different species... but they both seem to have the same genetic base, which is unrecognizable from ours. It's... a second genesis. What we found, back in Sol. It's life from a completely different structure, that we don't understand, that we can barely recognize."

[[Then how can we call it microbial?]]
[[Then how did we recognize it?]]


"How can we create fuel out of a microbe?"

"Fuel might not be the best word. The engine that powers the ship... well, I don't know if engine is the best word. There's nothing that takes the bacteria and transforms it into a propulsion or a form of energy. It's hard to tell what it does... the genetic base is unrecognizable from ours. It's a second genesis. What we found, back in Sol. It's life from a completely different structure, that we don't understand, that we can barely recognize."

Continue as group:





TO DO:
- figure out ice visuals / science
- map out "side" for joshua
- map out main line one ship
- figure out how to get player into water






Carefully, you weave between the holes in the ice. They vary in size, some barely visible. But they all seem to stretch deep towards something below.






They were round ovals of ice, 















It looked as if the sheet of ice were a strip of paint, and someone had taken a brush to lift up globs of it, sweeping up and painted across the air. Thin strips connected to other rising globs creating a network of paths. Deeper into the structure, the connections became thicker and thicker, as if they were a web. 





















The force pushes you towards the water below. You try and grab onto something to stop the fall on your way down, but the spikes in your arm slice through the ice of the glacier you hit against. Nothing sticks.

Your head is spinning, rotating between seeing the sky of clouds and ice and the light blue liquid coming closer and closer until

a million fires light up your body at contact with the surface. The cold immediately begins to devour you. The suit
	

































































Wake up, joshua's gone.
Find out actual mission.
Forest is gone?? Maybe not? Ah, perhaps everything is ice?

Choices: continue mission, look for joshua, (go back to Joana?)
	Everything should send you into ice place
	Joshua -&gt; goes back to ship
	Joana -&gt; CINDI identifies she's in that direction
	Mission -&gt; go back to ship, test out samples we have? Use databanks for more info?

Middles branch but end is the same: falling into the water / almost drowning.

Sarah nods, and continues towards the ship. You run after Yusuf and Teeneese.

The footprints weave through the forest of ice formations, leading you away from the ship. As you walk close to them, you notice entrances at the base of some of the ice structures. Some are sizable holes at its base, others doors or windows several feet up.

"Here," says Yusuf, coming to a stop. "The tracks stop here, and point towards that thing." He points at a nearby ice structure. It's particularly round on the outside, with an opening close to the ground. Inside, you see hints of ornate patterns, corridors, and open spaces.

Yusuf walks directly below it, under the opening, and jumps up towards it. He tries to grab an edge of the opening, but can't hold onto the ice. "Shit," he says, as he moves towards the ceiling.

"Idiot," says Teeneese. She follows, but activates the spikes of her gloves, allowing her to easily grab hold of the ice and carefully pull herself inside the structure.

Once you're inside, it's surprising how easily you're able to navigate the interior. It all feels oddly natural. Round corridors that open up into larger spaces. It's not that there was a clear pattern, if anything, the structure was objectively a maze. But it was one you had an intuition for, Yusuf especially. But his concentration didn't waver to admire the ice sculpture's architecture. Instead, he was looking for any sign of a dent in the smooth ice, a sign someone else had traveled through the space in a Proxima suit.

But before anyone saw him, there was his voice. ""?????

It's not from the comms, so you know he must be close. It's hard to tell where, the sound must be bouncing off the tunnels of ice. Yusuf looks up, and your eyes follow. There's what looks like a shadow hovering on the other side of the ice above you, four spots. Two sets of footprints.

"He's there." Yusuf moves down the corridor, looking for a way up there.

"Say something!" you hear Joshua scream. "Fucking say something!"


It's the same silhouette you saw in the desert. In this closed space, it looks strangely less imposing. The shape vaguely human, as before, still shifting. It looks more like an oddly shaped storm cloud than anything.

Joshua is at the other side of what is large spherical space, one opening you and your crew came through, and another at the other end. There's another at the ceiling. Other than that, the surface is perfectly smooth. His eyes look past the figure facing him, and find all of you.

"What did you do to him?" Joshua spits the words at Yusuf, ignoring the rest of you. "I thought your machines killed him, but this... it's worse."


The figure seems to fold into itself, and once it folds out, it appears as Ana Dandara.

[[Mom, is that you?]]
[[You're not my mother.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="695" name="Don't use the spikes." tags="" position="69760,160">You follow Yusuf's example, jumping up and trying to fumble your way to stability.

"You're not my mother." The figures eyes meet yours. Curious.

(if alive) Joana walks forward. "Uncle Amarizio..."

"That's... it's my dad." He turns to you. Teeneese's face is frozen, eyes more reflective as they take on light tears, fists clenched but still shaking.

All you see is the face of your mother, just as she sat in cryo, 

"It's... not him, is it?" There's a strange mix of relief and pain on Joshua's face.

[[Not who?]]
[[It's alien.]]

"We're each seeing someone important to us. He must be seeing... someone we left behind," says Yusuf. "Whoever it is, it's not him, Josh." 

"Then fuck off, will you?" Joshua runs towards the figure. "Just fuck off!"

The figure that looked like Ana takes a step back, and then fades back into cloud, dissipating into the atmosphere into what looks like nothing. It seems quieter, now, though you can't tell what noise disappeared. Yusuf exhales the oxygen he's been holding in his lungs.

"God. What were you thinking?" He turns to Joshua. "That thing could have hurt you. It's a miracle we found you at all. We have to stick together."

"Don't need this. Don't need this right now." Eyes are shut tight, back turned.

"Yes. Yes you do." Yusuf walks over to him, grabbing and turning his shoulders to face forward. "My first responsibility is towards your life. Above this mission, above my own. You're my brother, and I keep you safe. I bring you home."

"I'm not sure what memories you've been recovering, Yusuf. But they must be very different than mine. If you think I hold love for you in my heart. You made my life hell. You're not a brother, you took my father away from me. You're a thief."

"No, don't. Don't blame me for his actions. I protected you from--"

"Elliot. Elliot was his name. The person I saw, that I thought I followed here. Snuffed out by CINDI before we even got here, to keep the rest of you breathing. God, and you don't even remember. We were just going to... stay here, no matter what. Not go back. Every time I sleep, it's him. Even if dad's there, tormenting me, it melts away so quickly. It turns to him...

I feel anger because I know there's so much more I haven't recovered. Moments I'll never have back. Pieces of us, of him.... And even know, with the shards I have... I want... I don't know what I want. I want to stay here. I want him to be here, I... I...

I can't go back, Yusuf. I just can't. Somehow, this place is giving us back what we lost. I don't think that'll happen when we get back on our ship. I don't want to miss a morsel of him, so... I'm not leaving."

Yusuf's face looks empty. "What are you saying? You'll die if you stay here. Don't be stupid. Don't pretend you can do this. You could barely make it off the ship on your own, you piece of shit. You're coming back. You wouldn't survive a day. I'm going to take you back."

Joshua stands calm, finger on the trigger, completely in control.

You notice Yusuf's hand slip into a pocket, and he pulls out the old compass, the quibla he found on the beach. Slowly, he watches as the hand steadies. Waiting for it to settle. You know it does because there's a change. He smiles, puts the quibla down. And steps forward, arms raised.

More fire than you've ever seen. More orange and red than you ever cared to feel. The suit you're wearing floods you with cold to compensate for the fire as you're buffeted back, hitting a side of the room, cracking the ice behind you. The entire structure is destroyed. Ice splinters and tongues of flames and you're careening towards the ground, gray sky and blue ice all you see as you spin on your way down.

The spinning doesn't stop, even as you try and steady yourself. You're oriented enough to tell you're heading towards a blue layer of ice. Vague memories of physics simulations and free body diagrams come and go as you try and grasp what might happen when you make contact with the ground. Will you bounce up into the sky? Slide across the surface? Will the force be strong enough to break your bones?

The answer comes to you in shards, as you break through the ice surface and find yourself plunged into freezing water just underneath. A million fires light up your body at contact with the surface. Cold devours you, even as the suit attempts to flood you with heat.

The structure begins to shake as there's increasingly strained breathing.

Joshua lifts from the floor, floating and fighting to keep a straight face as his lungs gasp for oxygen, filling themselves with (???). But there's little pain, other than that. The occasional smile pushes through and, once the gasping is done, that's all that remains.

"What... did you do." His voice is lower than you heard it before. He stands. Eyes lock in at you. "What did you..." He's running at you as fast as the suit can take him.

"Floating over an endless pit, yeah I see." It stretches down further than you can see.

"Yusuf, use your drone," says Joana. Only now does Yusuf turn, and see you floating over the precipice.

(if good rel) "Oh, shit. I'm on it." (if bad rel) "Watch your step. Idiot." He pulls out a small disk shape from his pack, places it carefully into the air. There's a semi-circular strip he pulls off of one end, which snaps into a control mechanism.

Yusuf swerves his arms, and the drone follows. Leaning his hands forward, the drone moves across the chasm towards you, reaching close enough for you to grab hold of it.

"Now pull him back," says Joana.

"No wait," says Sarah. "We could use the drone, to see what's down there." She points into the hole in the ice. (if good rel) "Only if you feel comfortable."

You ask Yusuf to let you control the drone, and he asks why.

[[Because I'm better at it than you.]]

(side: looking into hole)







You hear him first. Shrill, high pitched. "You shouldn't be here! Why are you here!"

It's not from the comms, so you know he must be close. It's hard to tell where, the sound must be bouncing off the tunnels of ice. Yusuf looks up, and your eyes follow. There's what looks like a shadow hovering on the other side of the ice above you, four spots. Two sets of footprints.

"He's there." Yusuf moves down the corridor, looking for a way up there.

"Say something!" you hear Joshua scream. "Fucking say something!"




But you're accelerating towards the surface.




The force pushes you towards the water below. You try and grab onto something to stop the fall on your way down, but the spikes in your arm slice through the ice of the glacier you hit against. Nothing sticks.

Your head is spinning, rotating between seeing the sky of clouds and ice and the light blue liquid coming closer and closer until

a million fires light up your body at contact with the surface. The cold immediately begins to devour you. The suit







Need to add in some flashback: moment talking w Yusuf about relationship w/ Joshua.


(scene: yusuf and joshua have a confrontation about their background, rel. W/ "father"
	Also hints at "ideological" differences




"I'm not welcome back home. What choice do I have?"

There's two figures on the other side of the ice. One's holding something, all you can see is hazy outlines. But you think it must be the guitar, it must be Joshua.



















"Good," he says. "I'll bring him back here, if I find him."

"No, take him to the ship," you say. "That's where we need to go next."

You tell them about the video, the mission, everything.



"Illuminating."

"Ah, that is what I hoped to hear. Any pertinent new information, perhaps?"


"Confusing."

"Ah. Be that as it may, was there any pertinent new information, perhaps?"


Earth is dying. We all know it. But the sample we found on Enceladus gives us all a shot to get out of here. 


Your job is twofold: collect more of this fuel for the FTL drive, and determine the habitability of (planet name) for the human population. Bring back the fuel, and when you get here, we should have the Arks ready for full evac. 

And... there it is. Saving the human race. I don't have to say how important it is that you come back. You know that. You remember. 

 Once you arrive, the Arks will be ready. All we'll need is your fuel, and a location if we're lucky.



Soft particles of a frozen liquid hang in the air, appearing to stand still to your eyes. 



"My name is $name de Silva, rank is Captain, and my designation number is XXXX."

[[Tell me what we're doing here.]]

CINDI's voice was the first you heard when you woke up.


There's a hand on your shoulder. It's cold.


[[No shit, we have a problem.]]
[[Good, let's solve it.]]
[[Only one? Sounds like an easy day.]]

"No shit, we have a problem." You turn to face him. His eyes look panicked.

"It's Joshua. He's gone."


You turn to face him. His eyes look panicked. "Good, let's solve it," you say.

The eyes soften. "It's Joshua. He's gone."


"Only one? Sounds like an easy day." You turn to face him. His eyes look panicked.

"It's Joshua. He's gone."


You move out of the floating habitat, and step down onto solid ice. There's




[[Stop being a whiny bitch, Josh.]]



as if it were a frozen pillow here to smother you, but taking its time.







"Ghost" figure appears differen


(going in w Yusuf)


(following on your own)

The voices still echo from above you, and you find another path leading you up closer to them.





You hear him first. " (???) "



You're surprised by how easily you're able to navigate the interior. It all feels oddly natural. The voices still echo from above you, and you find another path leading you up closer to them.

Once the ice levels out again, you see the haze of two figures from the other side of the ice. One's holding something, all you can see is hazy outlines. But you think it must be the guitar, it must be Joshua.

"It's you, of course its you." The voice echoes through the ice with sharp precision. It was Joshua.

"I'll always be there for you. Please..." The other voice belongs to Yusuf.

"Please what?"

"Let me in. Tell me what's wrong. What you're seeing."

"It's... it's... I don't think I want to leave. This place."

"What do you mean? We have to. We have to go home."

"I never intended to go home."

"We found out why we're here, Joshua. We're here to save humanity."

"I know. I knew after the first dream."

"And you didn't... tell us?"

"I don't care. I never cared. Well, I did. I cared... so much. For so long. About pleasing dad. About hating you. Trying to live up to all his plans, his schemes. And... this was supposed to be our escape."

"We don't have to escape from anything, Josh..."

"Not with you." The words made something snap. "Never with you. He was one of the environmental engineers. Who CINDI... snuffed out to keep the rest of you breathing. We weren't going to come back. We were going to build a home here, and stay."

"I, uh... I didn't know. But we have each other, we--"


"I'm not sure what memories you've been recovering, Yusuf. But they must be very different than mine. If you think I hold love for you in my heart. You made my life hell. You're not a brother, you took my father away from me. You're a thief."


"I protected you from him. And you... you have no idea what he was capable of. What he did to my dad."</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="737" name="cut &quot;ice hole&quot; bit" tags="" position="73960,160">You try and put your foot down, and see nothing is beneath it. You're standing above a chasm.

(if alive) Joana notices first. "$name, you're--"

[[Floating over an endless pit, yeah I see.]]
[[Get me back to solid ground. Now.]]

"Floating over an endless pit, yeah I see." It stretches down further than you can see.

"Get me back to solid ground. Now." It stretches down further than you can see.


"Yusuf, use your drone," says Joana. Only now does Yusuf turn, and see you floating over the precipice.

(if good rel) "Oh, shit. I'm on it." (if bad rel) "Watch your step. Idiot." He pulls out a small disk shape from his pack, places it carefully into the air. There's a semi-circular strip he pulls off of one end, which snaps into a control mechanism.

Yusuf swerves his arms, and the drone follows. Leaning his hands forward, the drone moves across the chasm towards you, reaching close enough for you to grab hold of it.

"Now pull him back," says Joana.

"No wait," says Sarah. "We could use the drone, to see what's down there." She points into the hole in the ice. (if good rel) "Only if you feel comfortable."

[[Pull me back.]]
[[Send me down.]]
[[Have the drone go on its own.]]

"Pull me back," you say. "I'm not going down there."

The drone reverses course, dragging you behind it. Soon, there's solid ice beneath your feet, and you let go.

[[Thanks, Yusuf.]]
[[Could have warned me.]] (?)

"Thanks, Yusuf." You pat him on the shoulder before continuing on the trail of footsteps.

"Could have warned me."


"Send me down," you say. "Just go slowly."

(go to drone side bit)


"Have the drone go on its own," you say. "No need for me to go down too."

"There's a reason they didn't just send robots," says Sarah quietly.

The drone reverses course, dragging you behind it. Soon, there's solid ice beneath your feet, and you let go. Yusuf directs the drone back towards the hole.

[[Let Yusuf pilot the drone.]]
[[Ask to take over the controls.]]

He opens a visual feed, projected between the two controls in his hand, showing the view from the drone. You watch over Yusuf's shoulder.

You ask Yusuf to let you control the drone, and he asks why.

[[Because I'm better at it than you.]]
[[In case you want to go ahead and find Joshua.]]

"Because I'm better at it than you." The controls are easy to slip out from Yusuf's gloves, and hold with yours. There's barely a stutter as you take control. Yusuf scoffs, and begins to walk away, telling you he's going to go find Joshua. Teeneese goes with him, and Sarah stays behind with you to investigate the hole.

"In case you want to go ahead and find Joshua." Yusuf nods, handing over the controls to you. They slip off his fingers and onto yours with ease, there's barely a stutter as you take control. Yusuf and Teeneese continue, and you and Sarah stay behind to investigate the hole.

The ice gleams. Even in the dark and gray. The little light there is is sprinkled everywhere. There's small holes littered throughout, spiraling throughout. The holes aren't rigid, like those earlier. It's as if a whirlpool was frozen in the midst of its rotation. Multiplied throughout and strewn about.

There's the soft sound of waves. The rough warmth of the sun.

"Ana! Ana Dandara de Silva. Volta aqui. Agora." / "Ana! Ana Dandara de Silva. Come here. Now."

There's a young girl, hands stretched out, face towards the sky. Toes tickled by the water.

"Estava procurando voce todo dia. E agora, voce esta aqui na praia? Preciso seu ajuda. Estamos todos preparando para festa hoje a noite, para natal." / "I've been looking for you all day. And now, I find you here on the beach? I need your help. We're all preparing for the party tonight, for Christmas."

There's a mother, lifting her dress to walk across the beach sand in her bare feet.

"Ta certo," / "You're right," she says. "Voce ta completamente certo. Vem aqui." / "You're completely right. Come here."

The waves of the beach come and come again, bringing more creatures to shore and returning others to the ocean. The mother sits down next to her daughter, helping her lean up against her.

It was difficult for me to understand, that these things weren't so different. That the world I saw through your eyes was the same I had always seen through mine. That your language didn't erase my word-- doesn't erase my world. But I saw none of that, then. Only your strokes, moving up and down. I could not see how even that was a circle.

A different kind of chill comes over you, the kind you feel when realizing everyone's left a room without you noticing. When two hours disappeared in a moment. When the sun has set before you realize it's noon.

"I don't understand," says CINDI. "You should be right next to each other."

"You said it's different than the shore from before," says Sarah. "But how? What... does it look like?"

"All I see is rock. Red, gray. There's still a shore, a shallow liquid stretching out. And the telescope, standing out at its edge. But no dirt. No rivers. We're in the same place, but... different versions of it."

A sudden feeling of alienation/alienness overcomes you. Naked, stranded, alone. Mind fraying. Body vulnerable. I think it was only then you realized where you are: beyond the limits of what humans had touched. Beyond the familiarity of species, family.

No recovered memories could make sense of this.

I'm still trying to understand why it was now, this moment, in which this revelation occurs. Not the first time this planet transformed overnight. Not your first direct communication with me. You've gone through so much terror, and this shook you the most.

Disconnected. Yes. I see that, now. You all were stranded, but together. This was the first time you felt adrift with no net to fall back on.

You let your knees drop into the sand by the telescope, your hand drift across its cold scope. Though you can't see it, Sarah is doing the same, holding onto the last common marker between the two of you.

Sarah's calls of anguish only become more amplified, as images begin to cross your mind. It takes a moment to adjust, having an environment projected directly to your headspace. Closing your eyes helps, and the world around you starts to take shape.

Everything's red. Barren. The water behind you, dried up. Vegetation demolished. The sand is congealed and rocky. Even though you're simply looking at images through Sarah's eyes, you can sense the head they hold. Sarah's hands, appearing in front of your line of sight, keep switching where they lay on the floor to keep her from completely collapsing.

And then she turns up, and you see it. A whip of fire across the sky. Plasma closer than anyone should ever wish to see it, stretching out as if it were touching the atmosphere. Proxima Centauri always takes up much of the sky, but this is different.

"Oh god." It's the first time you've ever heard CINDI mention god before. "It's a solar flare."

The plasma stretches out from the dark red sun, pulsing with energy. Then, Sarah's view falls back towards the rocky ground. You only hear her heavy breathing and guttural grunts as she looks for somewhere safe to hide.

"I am connecting to the data stored locally in her CINDI chipset. I should be able to hear her thoughts, or at least parts of them. She could be expecting this, using it to communicate with you. Would you like to hear them?"

(if rooted)

As they approach, the figures turn into familiar faces. Teeneese is carrying Joana, struggling with the roots now woven around her entire suit. The once milky white color is wilting, burning black under the direct exposure to the radiation beating down from the star's flare. As Teeneese brings Joana closer to Sarah, you can see Joana is unconscious.

(if "bulbed")

As they approach, the figures turn into familiar faces. Teeneese is carrying Joana, struggling with her limp body. The once milky white color of the bulbed stub of what was once a root is wilting, burning black under the direct exposure to the radiation beating down from the star's flare. As Teeneese brings Joana closer to Sarah, you see gaps where her flesh is exposed, peeling and festering as Joana remains unconscious.

(if just Teeneese)

Teeneese leans down to try and help Sarah up. In her eyes, you see she too feels the twisting pain of the radiation contorting her cells. "She's dying," her lips read. The traditional short range communication is blocked, leaving only harsh static.

"All... dying." The words are almost coughed up by Sarah.

Eyes open, and you're back on the riverbank. The soft trickle of water as it meanders down, tickling your ears. It's this same place, this land, a few thousands of years later, that will be transformed into a coffin for your friends. You think, how can I then say time has no meaning? Time, that can demolish mountains, soak up rivers, unleash horrors?

Well. Time has only the power you give it. And you give it so much.

You can see both worlds, now. The picturesque riverside of your physical world and the images being sent to you from Sarah's mind through the quantum world. You look around, at the objects, at the habitats softly floating in the wind. You close your eyes, and see your friend(s)/crew collapsed on the floor.

"Can't die," Sarah says. "Have to see home." (edit here)

Home. That is a word we understand more than death. Where is home? I ask Sarah.

Sarah's fingers grasp at the ground. Through the gloves of her suit, she feels the dry dirt crack and crumble.

Yes, Sarah. We made a home, beneath the surface. Shielded from the radiation. Not all of us, some on the surface simply... changed. But most have laced themselves throughout the very fabric of this planet, its oceans, soil, magma, metal. We saw the flares that would plague this planet the very moment we saw its death trillions of years from now, the same moment we began to germinate on this very shore. So we knew to find protection from what surrounds us. Or, to accept the mutation and change. There was never any other way.

Eyes open again and the world grows quiet. "Make shelter," Sarah croaks, her voice and the pain you hear in it distant as you look up at the perpetual sunset of a calm star, its deep red light showering you in a comfortable glow. "In the past. For us now. Use the ground."

The image begins to distort. You feel the echoes of sharp pain twisting within your gut. Confusion. A voice, like Sarah's but... not exactly as you hear it. "Should... protect."

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

Fingers tingle with the sensation of fabric. Brushing across the exterior of a suit. Hear Sarah's voice. "And these will protect us from the flares?"

"They'll protect you from everything." The voice was (?? Ezro?) "The flares, temperature fluctuations, liquids and any harmful gas. And you've overseen their sanitation and bacterial sealing yourself. You'll be completely cut off, nothing can touch you." He smiled, comfortingly.

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

You snap back to Sarah's confusion and pain. Eyes move up from the ground, you see two figures before you, one holding the other.

"Help us," Sarah thinks, as radiation poisons her insides. You can see both, now. The picturesque riverside of your physical world and the images being sent to you from Sarah's mind through the quantum world. 

(maybe edit below)

 She hopes that CINDI is transferring these messages from her mind to you, but she barely understands quantum-communications as is, without the time travel involved. And yet, she holds on hope, without a plan, or even understanding of how it could be done. But the thought reaches you, thousands of years in the past. "If you can hear this, wherever you are in the past, do something to help us."

You look around, at the objects, at the habitats softly floating in the wind. You close your eyes, and see your friend(s)/crew collapsed on the floor.

"I can't die," Sarah thinks. Not for you, this time. "I... have to see home again."

Home. That is a word we understand more than death. Where is home? I ask Sarah.

"Home is..." Her thoughts cease to be words. Instead, there's the weight of dirt placed in your hands, black and mulched. Soft, comforting.

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

"This is ours," says an older voice. Piercing hazel eyes. "Always will be, and we belong to it as well. Regardless of what law and paper tell us. Regardless of who claims to have taken it. You lean down, scoop up this soil, this land, know our roots run deep. That does not mean we own it, or it owns us. But you know each other."

The wrinkled hands let go and leave the soil to sit in your fingers. "So I will stay. Come what will, I will stay with my home. All my life I have protected it, the best I can, and I trust in the years I have left, it will protect me."

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

Sarah's fingers grasp at the ground. Through the gloves of her suit, she feels the dry dirt crack and crumble. "The earth. You all made a home... beneath the surface, shielded from the radiation."

Yes, Sarah. Though not all of us. Some on the surface simply... changed. But most have laced themselves throughout the very fabric of this planet, its oceans, soil, magma, metal. We saw the flares that would plague this planet the very moment we saw its death trillions of years from now, the same moment we began to germinate on this very shore.

Eyes open again and the world grows quiet. "$name, you have to do something." There's another wince of pain as you hear her voice, but it feels distant now, as you look up at the perpetual sunset of a calm star, its deep red light showering you in a comfortable glow.

Hand brushes against the cold metal of the device's side. A control screen appears.

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

"This is what Mom used to do," says Joana, holding you in her arms. You can't speak, but you can feel the cold of the machine's metal as your sister brings you close to it. "She'd push this button here," she said, pulling up the control screen, "and a laser would come out from that end, and... all the rock would disappear, giving us a place to call home. Without her, we wouldn't have caves big enough for us all to live in. That's what she told us, anyway."

Joana looked around, the cave well lit by phosphorescent cabling above them. "Uncle says its important to know why we're here, so I thought I'd show you, so you know before you go."

She leans down to the floor, gently bringing you with her, turning you so she can see your face. "It's not fair." There's water welling up in her eyes, so she closes them. "I was... so excited, to see you grow up. Have a friend, here." Joana's face smiles, thinking about that world, where you both grew up together. "If I see you again, it'll be... when we're both boring and grown up. Forgetting... where we came from, and we won't even have each other to help remember."

The whirring continues, growing in intensity, piercing the silence of the riverside.

A bright white light suddenly protrudes from the drill, and pierces the ground. The dirt of the riverbank swiftly melts away, and soon the laser hits a rocky layer several feet beneath. The drill's progress slows, but is still steady, chipping away at the material.

Sarah still is looking up from the ground. "You're not... nothings going to save us, is it?" she thinks. "You don't want to use the drill." The flare continues to pulse, new loops spilling out from its arc across the sky. "I'd agree, if it wasn't for everything we've already done. (if had burial) Dumping corpses into the ice. (if Joana mixed) Melding Joana with a tree. We already fucked this up. But, sure, let this be the line."

Teeneese makes her way over to Sarah, and leans down. Her movements are awkward and staggered. But she manages to fumble her way down, bringing her helmet before Sarah's. Her lips are moving. "Tell him," you read, "we will live."

Immediately she stands, thrusting herself up. And slowly, makes her way towards the drill, sitting in their time, in the same place it sits beside you. Sarah leans up as well.

Teeneese reaches the drill, and begins to point it toward the ground, frantically pushing at the controls. A cylinder emerges from the top of the device, stretching out about an inch. The protruding end opens.

A bright white light suddenly emerges from the drill, and pierces the ground. The laser hits the rocky floor with force, beginning to slowly chip away at the material.

Sarah pushes herself to stand, shakily, and Teeneese walks back to steady her. The drill continues to dig into the ground.

We have always known how we will, as you call it, die. The star you call Proxima Centauri will continue to burn and burn for trillions of years. It will grow dimmer, and cold, and there will not be enough energy for us to take in to continue to live, no matter how well integrated we have become.

The sunset sky disappears as you descent into the dent the drill has made in the ground.

"You wouldn't want to go back to Earth? See it one last time before...?" Sarah leans forward, confused. "I know you never lived there, but-- sorry, it's just hard for me to imagine thinking of //this// place as... home."

The room's lights are dim, a soft yellow glow from the low ceiling giving the scene lighting. The shadows are long. Quiet settles back in.

"Everything's different now, isn't it?" Sarah puts her hand to her forehead, and leans back, closing her eyes. "We're sitting here, drinking fake champagne, trying to celebrate. And-- it's awfully quiet, isn't it? We confirmed and collected the first sample of living alien life. Not sure what I expected, but... I feel strange."

It's caked with thick, dry soil. If it weren't so dark, you'd see its crimson matched those of the leaves from before. Creases between different chunks ripple forward, lines connecting, smoothing out into spirals back into corners and patterns, repeating and crossing over each other. It was chaos but somehow you couldn't imagine them taking any other shape.

"You're here," says Sarah. "You made it."

"What did you see?" asks Teeneese. She's looking at you intently, now. As if you were a specimen. "On your way here?"

Teeneese looks skeptical. "That's all? 'It was dark'? Nothing else of note?"

There's a faint trickling, echoes of what you heard when traveling through time. You think it must just be memory. It's difficult to know the words to describe it with.

"We don't have much time, we can debrief later. We need to focus on the task at hand," says Sarah. She's holding a sensor from her portable lab, emitting a soft glow in the dark of the tunnel. It's picking up traces of us, all around. "This is..."

"What?" asks Teeneese.

"The tunnel... if this instrumentation is still working right, the walls all around us are lined with bacteria." Sarah looks up, her headlamp following her sight as it moves around. The interlacing grooves seem to shimmer slightly. "We should turn our lights off."

Her light goes out, Teeneese's soon after. In a moment it's complete darkness.

But slowly, you start to see a glow in the walls. Small silvery strings lacing the surface, below your feet and above your head. Some converge into the stronger grooves you noticed in the light, breaking off and branching and converging again further down.

As your eyes adjust to the darkness, the glowing becomes more pronounced. There's a flow, a pulsation to it, moving deeper into the ground.

"We must follow it," Teeneese says as she walks forward, her body slowly turning into a silhouette in the strange lighting. "It's leading somewhere. Presumably, all this microbial material pools together at the other end."

Sarah turns to you and motions to follow. Both of you start to move down. Without your boots, it's hard to keep your feet steadily on the ground.

As you all keep walking, it's impossible to remember which direction was the original ground. There's only one direction: down.

You've been here many times before, but never like this. The central table is occupied by a massive device. You count at least six power sources connected to it by frayed wiring. Several beakers have been inserted to one side of it, and several others lie broken, oozing liquid dripping from the device, to the table, and painfully slowly to the floor. You watch, as one droplet garners enough force from the moon's gravity to break from the static connection with the table. It moves in a straight line, down. But it takes its time. For a coloniazable body, Enceladus is fairly low in mass, and thus gravitational pool. A droplet of primordial ooze, even compared to that, is nothing at all. The drop did not fall quickly. Instead, it lingered, like a tear that cannot be wiped away, and fell, as you noticed the rest of the scene.

These broken beakers littered the room, the ooze decorating much of the surfaces. Something happened, that was clear. But now, all was silence. You almost didn't notice the back of your father's head as he sat in a chair, without moving a muscle. Barely breathing.

You pull a clean chair out from under a lab table, place it across from Issac, and sit. His eyes keep darting in silence, zooming across the room. Their light blue almost seemed to glow in the low light of the lab. You try and catch the eyes as they move about the room, crossing your path occasionally. They begin to move slower, each time.

"Then I'll speak quickly." Eyes narrow, head hunches. "The fuel. It can hurt." He gives a small nod. "It can hurt."

The nearly silent whoosh of the door cuts through the scene. You turn to see Ana Dandara with two members of station security, and medical personnel. She immediately turns her attention to the broken test tubes and material spread throughout the room.

"This laboratory is under a high-security lockdown until further notice," she says to the security officers. "Everyone who has made contact with the environment must be quarantined."

The medical professionals pull up masks and move towards Issac. His eyes scream fear.

"I just need to speak. I don't need quarantine." As he is pulled up by his arms, it looks as if every joint in his body is breaking out of a stiff, frozen sleep. "Let me finish talking to my son. Let me talk to my wife."

"We need to get you help, before anything else. We can talk soon." Ana keeps her distance, still under the door's threshold.

They take Issac out of the room. He attempts to struggle, but his body is moving too slowly, too haphazardly to be effective. Even so, one of the doctors injects him with something that turns his body limp. He's placed on a stretcher in the hallway.

Ana looks at him, lying there, and then turns to you. "Did you touch anything?"

"And what's the microbe's vote?" asks Sarah.

//These others, I do not believe they will listen to your words. My vote is to find a way to live here, with us. Perhaps by joining as $name and I have. That may be a path to understanding.//

"CINDI, you're the last one," you say. "What's your vote?"

"If I am to have a voice," says CINDI, "it must be in favor of completing our mission. There is no cost too great for what we have been sent here to do."

There's a moment, as you count in your head. The others do as well.

You look to Teeneese, as does Sarah, expecting a response. She laughs. "Go ahead. Maybe knowing we're going back to die on our own planet will give them comfort as we try to steal away what we deem an acceptable percentage of their population."

"You wanted to take them all," Sarah asks, confused.

"Because to them it won't matter whether we want to take a dozen or a thousand of them, we'll still be the attackers. They'll defend. So we shouldn't take a half-measure."

"We need to give them the chance to understand." Sarah is firm. Teeneese rolls her eyes.

"Give your chance," she says."

Sarah looks at you, and you know what she wants to ask. You [[nod.]] She takes your hand and moves towards the wall. "Both of you, just repeat the message, in your head, that we're leaving. That we'll use the engine one last time... and that's it."

"Just for a moment, and then it'll be like nothing happened at all." He smiles his warm smile, and it helps. You're comforted, but there's still a lingering apprehension. You've had the concept explained to you many times, but there's still something discomforting about having an artificial intelligence put directly into your body. Even if it's just CINDI.

The device fits neatly in the palm of Issac's hand. It's thin and cylindrical, smooth with a small opening on one side. You know what's underneath the opening: a delicate scalpel that -- briefly -- will dig under your skin, inserting a microscopic chip that will interface directly with your brain. (add real neuroscience here if you have time / more cindi backstory)

Almost everyone on the station has done this, but still there's something terrifying to you about it.

"Don't worry," says Issac. "I was scared too. But remember, it can always be removed. In fact, one day, you may have to! Everyone who came here from Mars, or Earth had to take their chips out before going into a sleeper."

"I understand this is difficult," says the voice of CINDI, still coming from the room's speakers, "but there are numerous advantages to the use of this interface. As you continue your education modules and transition into a part of the station's workforce, our efficiency in collaborations will become increasingly important. Issac can certainly attest to that."

Her cold logic was almost as comforting as Issac's words. CINDI had probably spent more time with you than Issac or Ana. She helped you learn to read and write, would answer your questions about the station. She was never busy, and was always there. You trust her.

"Okay," you say.

Issac brings the device to the side of your head with one hand, lifting your lowered chin with the other. "Hey, just look at me. It's going to be fine."

The incision is quick. Painful, but you knew it would be. The piercing stings but is then numbed, as a cold sterilizer is pressed against your head by the device.

You can feel it. The chip, lodged in your head. Soon, you'll barely notice it. But now, you feel something stretching out, connecting to your thoughts.

"Hello, $name." Not from the speakers, this time. "Does this feel comfortable?"

[[Not at all.]]

"When available, I will," she says.

Issac pats you on the back. "See? Not so bad. Tomorrow, CINDI can take you through the full setup protocol. But for now, you should get some rest."

"There is one aspect of setup procedures that may be pertinent to do before that," says CINDI. "$name, now that I am fully integrated, I can be far more helpful than previously when managing your circadian rhythms, especially during sleep. One aspect of this is a far more enjoyable and natural exit to your sleep cycle. Through auditory and visual stimulants, I can simulate a sunrise that can take place at a variety of locations on Earth. Options include the oceanside, a lush forest, or a snowy mountain. Alternatively, white noise can be used instead."

The static that woke you up your first night on this planet sits in your mind's ear. That is the choice you made, you know this. But... You can feel your tongue moving in your mouth. The muscles of your lips, in flux. There's no... cosmic force, guiding your words.

That was the easiest way to describe it. More than that, it was... an understanding. A map. An explanation, direction.

You see, your arrival changed everything. But... not in the way you understand. Not in the "this is what we had before, and you messed it up," way.

You changed //everything.// Because you've been here, now, since the beginning. Not starting at the beginning, but since the beginning. Your ship sits on our ground as early as there is ground to sit on. This tunnel has now been carved into the ground for over a trillion years.

Still, there's the sense that there was another way. But it's so distant, it's harder and harder to imagine. What it was like before.

//For creating an apocalypse eternal.//

Forgive the dramatic flair, but it's true. Your presence requires us to acknowledge cause and effect, linearity. Everything about us, our biology, our philosophy, what you might call language, it screams at this.

I took the time to try and learn the rules of this new paradigm, with you. But most did not. And are forced to live this contradiction. It tears them apart. They don't understand it, but they know its cause: you.

That's an odd phrase of yours, isn't it? The light at the end of the tunnel. Let's deconstruct that a bit: "end," first of all. There it is again, the inability to even express a concept as universal as hope without the stamp of linear progression on it. And there's the assumption the light's a good thing, in the first place. There's something to be said for the dark. There's safety. Sure, you can't see anything, but no one can see you. The light at the end of the tunnel could be blinding, disorienting, forcing a vulnerability and visibility you never asked for.

You think of none of this, as you climb your way through the bowels of our planet, reaching towards an opening that shines brighter and brighter as you approach it. Instead, you think of home. The planet you were sent here to save. The family that led you here. Issac and Ana, dead. Joana, who will never be the same. / Joana, dead. There will be no one waiting for you if you return, you realize. The man from the briefing video, perhaps. The one who wiped your memories... Sarah, Teeneese, they seem to have people they're fighting to save. It's hard to know what you're doing all of this for.

[[Yeah. They can be.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1078" name="can change again" tags="" position="108260,160">If the world was different before, that means it can change again.

True. That all depends, doesn't it? On what you do next. The others of my kind, the ones that lined the walls of that tunnel, they don't see that potential for change, yet.

All they see is you: a splinter in the fabric of our planet, your needles striking haphazardly but always leading to this place, this tunnel, and what you're about to do next.

//They're waiting, at the end of the tunnel. Their veins, in the wall, flowing down, it's... all for you. To guide you to the other end. They knew you'd follow, if they gave you a path.//

"What's... on the other end?" Sarah stands, looking down the tunnel. The shallow glow in the distance seems to shimmer.

//A trial. Though not as you know it.// It's not the right word, because your English doesn't contain the right word. But, it'll do. //They seek-- no, demand -- atonement. And they shall have it.//

"What, exactly, are we being put on trial for?" asks Teeneese, her gaze piercing through you, as if she thinks the microbe is sitting there, just beneath your eyes.

//For creating an apocalypse eternal.//

Forgive the dramatic flair, but it's true. Your presence requires us to acknowledge cause and effect, linearity. Everything about us, our biology, our philosophy, what you might call language, it screams at this.

I took the time to try and learn the rules of this new paradigm, with you. But most did not. And are forced to live this contradiction. It tears them apart. They don't understand it, but they know its cause: you.

Teeneese nods. "Let them try to judge us. We shall collect their microscopic courtroom and leave them to conduct their deliberations on our journey home." She walks forward with confidence, towards the glowing light at the end of the tunnel. You all [[follow.]]

It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the light. There's a pulsing you sense, as the silvery shine of what lies beyond the opening takes shape. Long roots, like those from the forest, interlace. They weave themselves throughout the massive spherical space. Its walls are littered with the same grooves on the tunnel walls, their structures even more complex and intricate, lines creating hexagons and then looping inward in smoother lines and pooling together. More of the microbial streams seem to spool out from the rock above, contributing to the network. And from the areas where they pool emerge the roots stretching out into the space itself.

The result is a mega-structure, pulsing with life. And at its center, a passage, created by the roots. Perfect circles hovering in the air, leading to the opposite end. A pool of liquid awaits, clear and blue. Dazzling.

In the water across the way, you see a small reflection of yourself. Though it's far, you can make out your matted hair. Sickly skin. Thin form. And, your crew, standing beside you. The silhouettes of their suits hulking over your exposed body.

One of the looped roots closest to you begins to unravel, twisting itself to make a path from the ledge of the opening where you stand to the passage. Intuitively, you understand the gesture.

For a moment, it seems like you might fall, spiral away in the low gravity. But you find your footing. Looking up, you feel small, as the roots stretch up several times your size. Your eyes get lost in the maze above you... it gives you a headache. You look down to the clear path ahead. One direction, one destination. Made clear in the midst of all this conjoined chaos.

"You're... going in there?" asks Sarah. You turn back to her, across the chasm.

(if invitation) "It's an invitation," you reply. "I'm accepting."

(if directions) "They made us a path," you reply. "I'm following it."

(if command) "I don't think we have much of a choice," you reply.

It's not far, but Sarah hesitates, looking down as she considers whether or not to follow. She knows she wouldn't fall down, more likely miss her target and end up ensnared in the web surrounding them. But there's something hardwired about your kind, always looking to your feet. As if your connection to the ground is the greatest comfort of all.

She pushes herself off from the entrance, and lunges towards you, and the passage leading to the water below. Her arrival is clumsy, stumbling as she tries to come to a stop, but you [[help her gain her footing.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1087" name="help her gain her footing." tags="" position="109160,160">(if completing mission)

Hesitantly, he obeys, catching a second fuel cell Teeneese passes over to him. His eyes seem dazed as Yusuf follows her, already moving up through the canopy of pulsing roots.

(if alive) Joana looks up at them, disgust on her face. The tear in her suit has broken open again, the rotting bulb/root keeping her alive still twitching. Turning to you, she smiles, pushing herself from the ledge and gracefully arriving beside you.

The roots beneath you are always shifting, not so much you're worried about being thrown off, but there's no stability. It feels as if they want you to walk forward, so [[you do.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1088" name="you do." tags="" position="109260,160">The reflections of your two/three figures grow larger as you walk down towards the pool of liquid. Now, you can see why the water is shining. Beneath the surface, there's what must be hundreds of microbes, globbed together to be large enough for you to see them. They shine, like light blue candles. Like stars plucked from the sky and stuck in gelatin.

(if alive) "That's them," states Joana. It's not a question. "They've been waiting for us."

//They have. Ever since you first found us, like this. Remember?//

(if not) "Do you think that's them?" asks Sarah. "The lights beneath the water?"

//It's them. You've seen us like this, before. You first saw us like this. Remember?//

And you begin to. Blue candles in the dark. Going out, one by one. It's... faint, but you start to remember.

"We've never seen a sample that potent before. Collect it, immediately." The voice is distant, growing stronger.

You're strapped into a drone operations unit, the movements of your body linked to a device under several kilometers of ice below you.

"I suspect they wish for you to enter the liquid," says CINDI. "I would not recommend doing so prior to further analysis."

"I hate swimming," laughs Sarah. "Of course we have to go swim."

As you continue walking, each step finds an odd rhythm: land, shift, weight moves forward, another foot lands, shifts, first foot rises and repeat.

The water always felt a bit too cold. A bit too still, when first entering. "Didn't seem the same as swimming in the ocean, or even a lake."

The pulses swell. Slowly, but rising in intensity with each peak.

"Less mud, I'm sure. And no snakes." Sarah laughs. "I never even used the pool on the station. Last time I swam was... on Earth. The lake, I told you about. Almost drowned."

There's an echo, small muffled screams.

"I think it's the earliest thing I can remember... my body saying: you have to breathe. You have to open your mouth. Knowing that if I did, it would kill me. The moment before I got pulled out... it lasted an eternity. Lips trembled. Fighting to keep them closed." Her eyes grow distant, the words begin to spill rather than be spoken. "Scratching under ice. Looking for the opening. Shadows moved towards me in the ice above. I was-- right there. Right there--"

The tug of a current, pulling you out. Crash of wave thrown against your tiny head. The salt sears through your nostrils. Gasp for air and you eat more.

"-- there's something I can't explain. Something ripping itself out of my bones as my lungs are bursting as the cold makes my body numb and-- I thought they were ghosts, beside me."

A voice, distant, coming from the shore. "Filha!" You see a figure coming to you as you're slammed back under.

"They chip away the ice above me and it's thin enough they break through and lift me up and I see them, at the shore amongst the melting snow it's melting far too soon and even I can tell, only seven years on Earth and every year I've ran across that frozen lake but this year it cracks and I almost drown and I see them, on the shore. Strange smiles, as the cold is clutching closer and closer to my heart and my wet clothes cling to me and I... I'm fading, but I still see their eyes... so much pain rippling through their love as they welcome me... sounds and sights I... can't repeat... but the sun begins to clutch me and the strong arms take me someplace warm and they vanish."

There's the clanking of chains the billowing of blood soaked sails the stink of shit from the belly of galleys washing up on these same shores. Corpses littered behind, the ringing of their chains the distant crinkling under the oceans pinging across time and it's under those waves that a little girl named Ana Dandara who would one day give birth to you on a planet called Mars sees what she thinks are ghosts when she sees

You. Staring at her. Eyes wide. And in surprise her mouth opens and the water fills in and below, there's a family waiting. Smiling, sadly. Broken metal shattered at their feet. Faces blurred, hearts full, and arms ready but

The girl is pulled up above the waves and the echoes of a mother's joyful tears reverberate below the waters telling everyone, It's okay. She doesn't die today. And the faces fade back into the waters and the mother's wails of relief turn to words of scorn and warning, but even then she can't stop from smiling that her little girl is safe as they swim back to shore out of the waters that already are growing too cold.

"I'm staying." She takes a few steps back. "Just... update me on the comms. If you can."

Turning back to the water, you're faced again with your reflection. It's up close, this time. You notice puss congealing above your cheek. Blisters about your feet. You look good, considering your travels through time/the bowels of this planet with little protection.

The water invites you, the soft whisper of the coolness it gives off. The beckoning of its clear teal blue. All it takes is a [[step.-&gt;Enter the water.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1099" name="You shouldn't. I'll go alone." tags="" position="110360,160">"You shouldn't," you say.

All it takes is a [[step.-&gt;Enter the water.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1100" name="Enter the water." tags="" position="110460,160">It's a small step forward and your body slips into the water. It consumes you quietly as you pass through the membrane of its surface. Your eyes don't sting as you leave them open, find yourself spinning as the water's surface soon finds itself beneath you and hands stretch out, the lights surrounding you moving in tandem with your body. (if sarah enters) There's a cacophony of bubbles from below you as Sarah enters as well.

The light blue water seems to grow darker. You listen, for a voice, like mine. Search for a pattern amongst the shifting lights. They seem to move faster, dancing through your fingers and arms, directing you to the roots dipping into the water, rising up from under you, branching and twisting about more freely than in the cavern. You reach out and [[grab one.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1101" name="grab one." tags="" position="110560,160">It's soft. You feel the pulsing, a heartbeat. Now, you close your eyes. Listen. Feel. You sense the root's material slowly growing around your hand and you begin to feel yourself stretching out... up out of the water, into the cavern above and then...

//Now, it's your turn. To see the world as another does.// This... weight is lifted, from me. The burden of thought squished through your words. There's an instant recognition. You feel part of that, too. It helps you manage the foreignness of feeling washing over you.

It's an explosion of sensation. Feeling yourself part of an entire planet, from its molten core to its trees and oceans and skies. Your mind tries to visualize it, as if you were looking down from orbit but... you can't. 

//Let go of your eyes. There's no need for images.//

You [[let go]] of the images.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1102" name="let go" tags="" position="110660,160">Instead, you let a multitude of minute movements wash over you. The way branches decompose into dirt. How grains of sand, microscopic puzzle pieces that can be pieced back together into the rocks they came from. Bacteria eating its way into a tree's trunk, sinking itself into its roots into the soil.

Listening as the earth's minerals speak of when they were interstellar flotsam, congealing in rotation around a dim star until one day there was enough to be something more than each specks of dust and metal.

The way the planet spins about itself and spins about the sun and how the sun tugs, pulling it closer but the planet's in motion and must stay in motion and finds itself continuously falling just out of its fiery path, swinging about in what you call orbit. And one day, the planet's twirl about its own axis finds itself in rhythm with its dance about the sun.

It's as if there was a ball in your palm, spinning on its own as you carried it with you, and then it fell still. Clasped around your fingers. Able to turn about precisely at your control, one side always facing your gaze.

One side always under the sun's watchful gaze. Scorched by its splendor. Volcanic rupture spewing out gas carried off by wind from the sunlit side to the sunless. And that black void, where ice reigns in the darkness, its ice bites at any roots that attempt to emerge from the dirt or waters. But still, you feel it. Through the ice the water and rock deep beneath it. Through the few microbes that sustain themselves in the cold and dark.

But between, there's the strip of continuous sunset. Where the roots can lace themselves carefully throughout, protruding into magnificent trees branching towards the skies. Where waves lap up against a rocky shore and molecules germinate into life that trillions of years later will whither up in the slow and cool demise of its host star, unable to supply the energy to feed us but it's the same moment of our birth, on the rocks, where we will soon be sewn throughout this place. Linked with the earth and its cosmic creation stories. All contained within the one moment of everything.

And you sense all of this. There's a peace, a balance to it. The scope of life's creation and demise, ground molded and flattened, each moment no more present than the other. Layers, not frames. There's an understanding between each moment there's nothing above the other. Nothing can exist without the other.

Until your [[arrival.]] (make this somehow a mechanic)</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1103" name="arrival." tags="" position="110760,160">And then, something pierces that: a silver bullet finding its way to land in the thin ocean of the planet's adolescence. Bullet eating at so much of you. You start to feel it, the machine inside that brought it here. Engine, we hear the word. From one of the strange husks that emerges from it. Husks carrying so much that's like us... and ignored by you.

From the moment of inception, we see it all. The shattered remains of the ones that you used to get here. Our own broken bodies, once you use ours to return with the rest in tow. Stretched thin into lines: one moment into a million, in sequence, from point A to B. Compressing our existence into a ferry line on which to travel. As if we are the cattle you raise and consume on your Earth: to ride until we collapse.

All this we know, and now you feel, as the figures [[emerge.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1104" name="emerge." tags="" position="110860,160">There's seven, of the entities. Six in their suits and one that laces between them. Weaving all together, connected by waves that now ring through our air, where many of us drift in the wind.

And within each there's the trillions like us, laced throughout their bodies. The suits they wear attempt to contain them, but they leak. Of course to do. And then one suit cracks: their world spooling out into ours, and ours into theirs.

Some of us sought to understand, like me. Based on the strange impressions you made on our world. Foot splashing into still water. Gashes in our trees and roots. Cracks imprinted in our ice. Pieces of us stuck into tubes and petri dishes. To sit isolated and await what we know is to come. What has already come. What is now: our evisceration for their salvation.

Curiosity pivots to something new, something never felt by any of us before. (And, don't forget, that word "before" changes us, too.) Spasms of fear, vibrations of it rippling throughout our network, jostling every organelle and membrane. Motions we had never sensed before. And there it is again: before.

But perhaps they don't know what they do, and that is all. Once they realize, that will be the end of it. Perhaps all we need to do is communicate. And so, I volunteer to learn how to transfer this understanding of our pain to them.

//Had I known how much I lost, doing so, I wonder if I would do it again.// I share this thought with you, as I revisit my journey, as you look on at yourself as the other.

The answer is yes. I do choose to do it again. Every time.

My search to communicate begins with the others like us, the ones leaking and oozing out from the creases in their shells. The ones they cannot contain despite the efforts of the best sterilizing sprays. Some of us begin to sift through the periphery of their bodies, tugging at the web of life each hosts. It's there we start to sense what is whole about each of them, all that led them to be here. Each of their stories.

Memory. It's encoded in your bones, your blood, the strings you call DNA.(your/their?) And though its been blocked from their minds, it's preserved by the ecosystem of the corpus/body. It's there we begin to glean how they see the world: the flow of one action into another, the language they've built around this. And I take note. I learn, vigorously.

I know it's all I can do to survive. For any of us to survive this.

These unearthed memories, I thought it could be our gift to them. An offering of understanding. And so we sought to construct pieces of the worlds they left:  telescope, for $name; drill for Joana; filter for Sarah; qibla for Yusuf*; guitar for Joshua*; blackbox for Teeneese.*

But instead, they saw this as a threat. / But instead, they only became more confused. / They saw it as an invitation to learn, which was a start.

The rest of the story plays out as you know it does. We try to shape our forms like them, find faces from their pasts, but they don't understand. Their only concern to desperately latch onto the past they've thrown away, not listening to the meaning behind our presence.

Until we save one. Until it is ours, and we are in it. Giving life to its lungs. No shell, just body. And it's then, we begin to talk. If only you would listen. / Thankfully, it listens.

With every step of this story, from each moment that passes to another, it's harder to hold onto the world as we once knew it. That planet, where birth and death are one, where time swirls in a fishbowl and not through a thin canal, it's gone for us. Shattered, because of [[you.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1105" name="you." tags="" position="110960,160">You. Whose drill has dug into this soil and rock, a straight line down to this planet's heart. Our heart. Forging yourselves a tunnel so you may come and siphon us away.

It's okay, my kind won't run. Instead, they invite us here. Your kind: the invaders, who seek to take us from this place, and me: who hoped your violence was simply ignorance.

I so desperately wished I was right. / I only hope what little common understanding we have found will be enough. (depending on how much you've listened) 

Slowly, you let your eyes open once more. The pulsing of the roots slow down. Each beat rippling the waves of the water, just slightly. The lights still dance about you, but differently now. They keep their distance, as if forming a perimeter.

They've brought you where they want you, and intend to keep you here, without any more contact than necessary.

//Now, do you understand? What you have done to this place? Before you even turn on one of your machines. You've stripped away so much.//

[[I understood before.]]
[[We took away so much.]]
[[Change is normal.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1106" name="I understood before." tags="" position="111060,160">"You've told me all of this," you tell me. "And I've already told you: if I can, I want to fix it. / There's nothing I can do. / I don't care." (based on previous responses)

//There is no fixing this. That's what you don't understand.//
//Even bringing you here cannot shift a mind already made, apparently.//

You turn about, sliding your hand out of the root's groove. Joana and Sarah are floating in the water with you, eyes dazed. They must be experiencing what you are as well. The roots connected to Joana's body are healing, growing brighter and slowly elongating. (adjust if Joana's dead)

//Now, that they have shown you all this, I believe it's time. For your atonement.//

The microbes in the water begin to fall into a formation, the chaotic movement splaying inward towards a rhythm, smoothing out into a rotation around you and Sarah / you, your sister, and Sarah. Soon, they cover you like a sphere spinning about the two/three of you. Their light overpowers anything past them, giving the impression you're in a small spherical room. It's impossible to tell your orientation compared to the water's surface.

//They do not know your words. Nor wish to learn them. I have been asked to translate for them, to be their spokesperson.//

"Whose side are you on, in this?" asks Sarah. Without her helmet, her long hair stretches out, dangling without direction. But her eyes are wide open, darting about with concern. 

//Only the side that eases the suffering of my kind. It need not be at the expense of yours. If there is to be a... reconciliation, this must happen first.//

The lights give off an uneven twinkling. It's hard to tell if they're creating it, or if it's coming from light elsewhere, above the water's surface. Wherever that is. It makes you feel as if they are curious, awaiting a response.

Maybe if you treat microbes badly?

Not just interested in understanding for "wholeness"

Want to force you into their mindset, the way you forced them into yours
Win the "argument" of linear vs. Non-linear thinking

Convince you that you are nonlinear beings as well, that linearity is a fiction created for yourselves. Take AWAY the notion of free will.

	Your contradiction can be choosing not to do that. With potential deeper actions.

	As they are saying this, plot streamlines you towards leaving.
	Even if you choose not to, Teeneese moves towards that.
	
	Ooh maybe she leaves to bring them back on her own!

	And then, if you stay, have to go through recent or ancestral memory to disrupt.

//They will not simply let you do this. Not with this gap in understanding, not with this world left incomplete.//


(if asking them for help, OR if Sarah believes enough in microbes to go against plan)

"Please." Even in the water, you sense the fear from Sarah as she communicates with them. She pushes down her understanding that what she's asking is something that cannot be asked. "Whatever the reason, however the death of our world came to be, it's here. It brought us here. And... you can help. We are here, asking for your help."

The pulsing stops. This is... not what they expected.

And we don't deserve to just walk away. And that question they're asking? I want to know the answer too. Where we came from, on the scales of centuries, not just the decades we've been alive, all that informs our futures. How we got into this mess. Maybe, if we see our pasts... further back than just the memories we've uncovered, we can find a way out of it."

"That will take time," says Joana. "But yes, you're right. This place finds the deep joy and pain of the world we came from, etched across our bones.

From the cracks between the lights making up the sphere surrounding you, there's the silhouette of a figure / two figures. Teeneese (and Yusuf) must have finished

Sketch of scene:

Intro/start: our microbe gives set up. Explains, for us, everything's fine as long as we understand it, from beginning to end, its complete evolution, so we can see it all at once: how something came to be and ultimately, how it dies.

First part of that question is: why did you come here at all?
Answer: our world is dying. Want you to save it.

Brief discussion, sarah (or someone else?) asks if there's any way to use microbes to save it without harming them
	Mention hybrid idea, protag as the example

	IS considered if you've treated microbe REALLY well, always made choices it approves of.
		IF works: "repentance" is ensuring safety / sanctity of microbes in these hybrids; can leave later, do a less stressful version of "escape" route (still w shitty results)
	






	LIKELY is rejected, they don't want contact at all. Would need stellar example of success to convince.

But, they dig deeper: why is the earth dying?
Answer: destroying the land.

Then: why would a people destroy their own land?
	If it wasn't theirs to begin with. No kinship, leads to exploitation.

Question isn't getting fully answered. Proposes new repentance: 

Opens up into discussion of can / can't do that, diff options, segir








(this should be: something mechanical and weird.)

All they want to know is why. Why do something so senseless and strange.

One answer: bc our world is dying.
Why would you let your world die, by your own hand?
Bc we suck / its complicated / who knows


This is your repentance: stay with us, here. As we try and understand how you came to be at this place. Why your world is the way it is.





Brainstorm:





After all this, their "punishment":

For you to remain, in the pool, surrounded / trapped

	Stops you from doing anything more while containing your microbiome within you (if you die, microbiome eats you up and then eats / spreads elsewhere)
	Opportunity to learn more about human people, history. Better understanding of why there was this violence that led to things being the way they are.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1130" name="Escape peace" tags="" position="113460,160">And are hoisted through, back into the cavern.

DON'T FIX YOUR SHIT:

4) Not trying to undo. What's done is done. Can choose:
	Take only enough microbes for trip home
	Take as much as possible, to complete mission
	Use yourself as "fuel" for trip home.

5) Exit pool into a new geo-space, no more flares. Back to ship. Fly home.

6) Arrival at ProXima. Put in quarantine. Convo with leader.
	If: only took enough for trip home, or used yourself

		Proxima asks you to operate one ark. Can choose:
			Yes, I'll do it.
			No. Then, will be forced to.

		AND use you (and maybe Issac) to "breed" microbes. Can choose:
			To be okay w/ this.
			To not be okay w/ this.	

	If: took as much as possible

		Try and convince hybrid pilot idea (can, but hard, to work)
			If it works, you headline hybrid pilot program. Very much human-centric, using microbes as a tool. But still, joined.
			If doesn't, kept to be studied, for potential "breeding of more	

		Try and convince to let you out (won't work)
			Kept to be studied, for potential "breeding" of more
	
	For all options:
		Can ask to be killed by Proxima b/c so infected
		Can be suffocated by microbe</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1131" name="Escape." tags="" position="113510,110">You decide to escape. CINDI tells Sarah and Joana as well. There's an understanding, though neither seem pleased.

With a push from your legs, your body shoots up towards one end of the microbial sphere of lights, and you [[break through]] the perimeter.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1132" name="break through" tags="" position="113660,160">The lights explode in a million directions across the pool. The pulsing is disrupted as energy seems to dissipate at random, high-pitched humming reverberating throughout the water.

//Of course you had to touch them.// 

Chaos consumes you. There's no telling what direction is which, where the surface could be. There's a brightness you follow until it dissipates and changes. And... its harder to breathe. 

Until there's a hand. Piercing through what you now see as the thin barrier between water and cavern. The elegant white of the Proxima uniform enters the water and sits still amongst the movement. As you turn, moving toward it, you see the distorted image of Teeneese on the other side. The image of her body refracted in the turbulent water. As if she was thin as paper, flapping in the wind.

You [[clasp the hand.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1133" name="clasp the hand." tags="" position="113760,160">And are hoisted through, back into the cavern. Sarah and Joana soon follow, with the help of Yusuf. You all manage to reach an edge of the cavern, close to the water. Like everywhere else, its lined with microbial ooze.

The pathway that led you to the water is gone, there's only the network of roots, also fluctuating haphazardly as the microbes did in the water. Contorting themselves and shifting.

"They didn't take kindly to when we started to collect the samples," says Yusuf. "But we got them." There's a defeat in his voice. (if alive)

"No more than we need for the trip home," adds Teeneese. / "Our sample cells are full, more than enough to fuel the arks."

There's a sudden change. You notice the silence first, as the hum you first heard under the water vanishes. Then, the stillness. As the roots slow their movement their pulsing and the chaos fades.

It feels as if you are being watched. You are.

"$name/Captain, I recommend an immediate return to the surface." 

Across the cavern, you see the tunnel's opening. You [[take a step towards it.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1134" name="take a step towards it." tags="" position="113860,160">The moment your body moves, there's a crunch. The roots woven throughout the rock pull down, and the entire network moves as one to unhinge the Earth down upon you. Teeneese instinctively pulls out her (space gun), blasting away rock as it plummets towards you. The tunnel entrance won't stay open for long.

(way larger idea, but integrate legit inventory system? So in these situations, you have different objects, and can click on them to see what they can do in a situation. Here, best thing would be to click on drone, but there's other options as well.)

You pull out the assistant drone, as Teeneese covers you.

"What are you doing?" asks Sarah. "We need to get out of here!"

"That's what I'm doing," you say, as the drone comes to life. "I'm handing control over to you, CINDI. You're going to take us out of here."

You clasp onto the edge of the drone, and stretch your hand out to Sarah. She realizes what you're doing, and takes your hand. You pull her up to the drone, and call out to Teeneese. She turns and jumps on as well.
(edit for better description)

(if alive) Yusuf sees what your doing, and takes his drone out as well. 

The drone(s) begin to move, able to easily lift you and your crew in the low gravity. The roots and rock continue to ricochet across the room, but CINDI expertly navigates around them, leading you all back into the tunnel through which you came.

The chaotic noises suddenly cut out, replaced by the quiet of the tunnel's interior. But the silence is short lived. Behind you, you hear the rock and metal and organics clawing up after you, collapsing the entrance to the cavern. The tunnel feels cooler as you swiftly move up through it. Wind rushes down your body as you move upward, it's difficult to see, but you try. Unsure of where to look.

[[Up the tunnel.]]
[[Behind you.]]
[[The tunnel's sides.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1135" name="Up the tunnel." tags="" position="113960,160">Above, there's a growing speck of light. As it approaches, coming into focus, you see its a sandy gray. An overcast sky, threatening rain. Nothing has felt more comforting.

And in a moment there's a switch and the tunnel turns to sky, stretched out above the thin coastline you've come to know in so many different forms. The drones slow their ascent and come to rest, hovering above the surface. You watch as the roots from deep beneath the soil crawl up to the surface and finding they're too late, satisfy themselves with collapsing the rock around them and closing the tunnel for good.

Waves on the shore. Trees rustle in the wind. Screech of some creature. Snap of a branch. You look out, and find a breathing world. More filled with sound than you can recall having found before. Feeling more familiar than you think it should.

"It's because of us," says Sarah, watching something with wings sail past you and down towards the coastal forest. Its leaves now more beige than maroon. "Some combination of the bacteria we brought, or maybe... the memories we brought too."

[[Our new home.]]

[[A gift we leave behind.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1136" name="Behind you." tags="" position="114060,160">Below, the roots lash out at the ground, tearing into the tunnel's sides to bring the rock down. The drones move just fast enough to keep them a safe distance.

"Let's hope it doesn't rot as quickly as we let ours." She directs her drone to turn. The ship is visible, a monolith on the ocean's horizon. 

The trip back to the ship goes quickly, the drones placing you gently onto the shallow waters just beside it. The downward facing door opens itself up for you, though this time an elegant ladder does as well. A simple poll with thin rungs.

It's quiet, as those who remain make their way back towards the ship. Teeneese and Yusuf checking their samples. Sarah and Joana soaking in their last views of this place like no other.

You wonder what the others are thinking. Who may not make it back. That this may be the last beautiful thing they look at. You think of them, the ones with radiation eating away at their organs. But you do not think of yourself, what is eating away at you. That this may be the last beautiful thing you see.

And you have ruined it.


(if collected for all the arks)

Teeneese checks her pack, confirming the dozens of fuel cells are there. Each containing trillions of us. She smiles, believing this will make it worth it. That this will save your species, and that will be your salvation. Satisfied, she begins her ascent to the ship.

//$name... you don't have to do this. You can as her -- command her, as Captain -- to leave them behind. I can take-- we can take us home. I'm already inside you, contained-- there's your sample! Here, willing to be the conduit for your voyage. There's no need to harvest us like this. Not even for one trip.//

She pauses her climb up the ladder, and turns to you. All could hear me, though that wasn't my intent. These weren't planned words. These were words leaking out past the time I put a stopper on my hope.

//I can feel the deadness in your heart. As you do this. I can feel as you slowly sever the thin strings connecting you to your own humanity. So you cannot feel the sting of these words as I desperately try to make you care. So you need not listen as I tell you, so many times I am tempted to fry your brain and be done with it, that you do not have to do this.// 

"You're not still listening to it, are you?" Teeneese's is dry. As if she intended the comment to be funny, but couldn't muster the energy to properly make a joke. Still, she hasn't started climbing again.

[[It's talking, I'm not listening.]]
[[They're not wrong. We shouldn't do this.]]

(if just collected enough to take home)

(if alive) From his pack, Yusuf pulls out the filled fuel cell, the life captured within it shimmering and shifting, catching his eye as he walks over to you, and places it in your hands.

"I know this is our ticket home, but... I don't want to be the one to bring it onboard. I figured, if that's anyone's burden to bear, it's yours... Captain." He slinks away, leaving the cannister with you.

(if not) From her pack, Teeneese pulls out the filled fuel cell, the life captured within it shimmering and shifting, catching his eye as he walks over to you, and places it in your hands.

"I look at this, and I only think of our shame. As we let our species die, going only far enough to save our own skins. I won't be the one to carry this. It's yours, Captain." She storms away, leaving the cannister with you.


It's lighter than you expect. The glass cold to touch.

"Do they mean... you could operate the engine?" asks Sarah.

(if alive) Joana smiles, as Yusuf closes his eyes. Had you asked, in a universe where the two of you could sit and talk about all these adventures one day across a drink, he would tell you how he prayed for you to find a path home, one with a sink on the side of the road that could wash out the stains of blood on your hands. You'd tell him to stop thinking he's Shakespeare.

But neither of you would have that drink. Not these versions of you, not after today.

"It will be painful," says Teeneese. "I don't know how much, but it would presumably do to you something similar as what it does to them. Not as bad." She shrugs. "But bad enough."

(if alive) "It's okay. Whatever you choose." Joana's eyes reach out with warmth.

"I know this is our ticket home, but... I don't want to be the one to bring it onboard. I figured, if that's anyone's burden to bear, it's yours... Captain." He slinks away, leaving the cannister with you.

It's lighter than you expect. The glass cold to touch.

//$name... you don't have to do this. I can take-- we can take us home. I'm already inside you, contained-- there's your sample! Here, willing to be the conduit for your voyage. There's no need to harvest us like this. Not even for one trip.//

Teeneese is starting to climb up the ladder, but pauses, turning back to you. All could hear me, though that wasn't my intent. These weren't planned words. These were words leaking out past the time I put a stopper on my hope.

"Do they mean... you could operate the engine?" asks Sarah.

(if alive) Joana smiles, as Yusuf closes his eyes. Had you asked, in a universe where the two of you could sit and talk about all these adventures one day across a drink, he would tell you how he prayed for you to find a path home, one with a sink on the side of the road that could wash out the stains of blood on your hands. You'd tell him to stop thinking he's Shakespeare.

But neither of you would have that drink. Not these versions of you, not after today.

"It will be painful," says Teeneese. "I don't know how much, but it would presumably do to you something similar as what it does to them. Not as bad." She shrugs. "But bad enough."

"You're right about that." The laugh twists into something more pained. "It's all over, after this."

The engine room sits at the middle of the ship, past the cryo room, computing, and storage. It's shaped like half a sphere, the flat side glass, showing the innards of the engine itself. It's gigantic, extending up through the remainder of the ship. There's a central pillar with sparse spokes. Though you've never seen it at this size, you start to recall the blueprints. A massive centrifuge, able to distill the fuel into its composite parts. Spin those composites fast enough, and a reaction occurs that dislodges the ship from space-time, allowing it to be thrust and skipped across its surface.

At the room's center is a panel, sitting on a stand protruding from the end of the half-sphere opposite the window. It's made of clear glass, making the piping visible within that connects a small opening, sized perfectly for the insertion of a fuel cell, to the room's floor. The container is in your hand, its contents swimming at the same pace as before. They know what's to come.

"Preparations for departure are in order," says CINDI. "The crew is re-entering cryogenic sleep. Our course is plotted. All that remains is to insert the fuel cell, and for you to return to cryo."

You step up to the panel, and [[insert the fuel cell.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1151" name="insert the fuel cell." tags="" position="115560,160">There's a quiet click as the fuel cell fits into the opening, and rotates. Through the glass, you see the container's contents flow down to the floor, where its taken to the engine itself.

//You should watch, if you mean to do this.//

"I do not recommend that. Though the trip itself will appear to pass quickly, the cryo chambers are to ensure your bodies remain stable during the dislodgement from space time. There is no way to know the effects of remaining conscious for this."

The shimmering, silver substance shoots up through the pillar of the engine.

[[Go into cryo.]]

As you turn, the centrifuge begins to spin. Whipping my brethren into a pulp unrecognizable. Broken and alone, as the engine continues to spin and spin and then the door behind you closes, and the whirring dulls into silence as you make your way back to the cryo chamber.

Coward. If you're going to commit genocide, at least have the respect to listen to our screams. Be there to twist the knife. I'd rather see you in relish this than run away.

Because it does not grow silent for me. When the door shuts behind you. When you lie in the comfort of your sleeper. I feel the pulverization occurring several meters above us. You hear their screams, too. Not screams, of course. We don't have mouths. I just share yours. But all the same, you feel them, as you drift into artificial sleep. 

There's a rumble as the impulse engines lift the ship up away from the planets surface. As the echos of our pain creep up from my consciousness into yours. And all you can do to bury the horrors you have unleashed is thinking of why you tell yourself you did this: you think of [[home.-&gt;Proxima Return Exploit]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1153" name="Stay and watch." tags="" position="115710,110">You decide to stay, knowing I'm right.

Broken and alone, as the engine continues to spin and spin and I break, too. Because this is what will be left of all of us, when your kind is through. This is what it will mean, to be like me...

That pulp rains down the sides of the centrifuge, distilling itself into thick globs of silver and glowing blue. Pieces of those you have taken.

We watch through the glass, as the machine continues and those pieces are split and splayed about. The ship begins to shake, the nuclear impulse engine propelling us from the planet's surface into orbit. There's a rumble, as the engine continues to spin, preparing itself for the journey. Lights in the room switch off, leaving you alone with the low glow of your victims spinning in the engine, and the light from a small window at the side of the room. 

You [[turn your head]] to look outside, and watch as the planet's landscape shrinks out of view.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1154" name="turn your head" tags="" position="115860,160">There's fire lapping the outside of the ship as you puncture the atmosphere. Stars begin to appear, one or two. Then more. Until the fire stops and there's quiet. Trillions of stars bursting through the blackness of space.

In the dark of the room, the bacteria in the engine seems to glow as well. Becoming stars amongst the others. It would be beautiful, if not for the screams. If not for the bursts of light that begin to blind you as each of us is ripped to shreds. As the engine grows louder and louder amassing more and more of our innards, the paste disrupting the fabric of space-time soon about to burst.

The flashes of light cause you to slip and you find yourself on the floor. Each successive burst draining your eyes as you feel something shift and shake and a nausea rising and all your body wants to do is shut off and you hear us, still. Because I hear them all, and I want you to hear them as they think of how they are not the first. How they will not be the last. And there's no way to see how those can be the same, anymore. Everything can't be felt at once because right now, there's only pain. There must be progression, linearity, to allow there to be some unseen end to this cycle, some unseen peace. That's when I know we've truly lost.

You're almost gone, now. Writhing on the floor. Not from the pain of the lights, or the jostling in the fabric of the universe. Writhing from us, from me. That brings me some small amount of joy, as you desperately try to shut us out.

At the room's center is a panel, sitting on a stand protruding from the end of the half-sphere opposite the window. It's made of clear glass, making the wiring visible within that connects a small opening, sized perfectly for the insertion of a fuel cell, to the room's floor.

//Break the top of the panel. We will need to find a way to integrate ourselves with the delivery method designed for the fuel cell.//

[[Break the panel with an empty fuel cell.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1156" name="Break the panel with an empty fuel cell." tags="" position="116060,160">You take an empty fuel cell, and approach the panel. Both are glass, but you assume the fuel cell's is stronger, since its design is meant to contain, and the use of glass in the ship design ornamental more than practical. Lifting the fuel cell, you [[bash]] it against the panel.

The glass shatters and ricochets across the room. The delivery system, designed to have the fuel cell inserted inside it, remains. There's a wire and a tube, hooked to the delivery system. Once you [[pull that off,]] both hang loose.

//Connect the wire to your body and the tube to your bloodstream. It's thin, so I suspect you can use it like a needle.//

[[Insert the tube and connect the wire.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1157" name="Insert the tube and connect the wire." tags="" position="116160,160">You take the thin tube, and carefully insert it into a vein on your right arm. There's a wince, as it breaks your skin, and small beads of blood pool about the insertion. The end of the wire seems to have some kind of residual glue on it, and easily sticks to your other arm.

"I am not comfortable with this," says CINDI. "However, in theory, this should work."

[[Tell her to start the engine.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1158" name="Tell her to start the engine." tags="" position="116260,160">"Good," you say. "Start the engine."

The first sensation is jolts of electricity, searing through your body. Causing your sight to flash in and out. Then, there's the draining of your blood. Body feeling weaker and weaker. You feel the needle sucking material out of your body.

Within the centrifuge, you see crimson red flowing through the central pillar. Soon, its raining down the sides, as the engine begins to rotate and spin. Within the blood, you see what was inside of you: thick globs of the same silver and blue substance. Pieces of me.

We watch, as the machine starts to spin and we watch our own blood and body split and splayed about through the glass. The ship begins to shake, the nuclear impulse engine propelling us from the planet's surface into orbit. There's a rumble, as the engine continues to spin, preparing itself for the journey. Lights in the room switch off, leaving you alone with the low glow of your red blood spinning in the engine, and the light from a small window at the side of your room.

More jolts of electricity. More blood flowing away. You feel the stars expand, beyond the window. Into the dark of the room. Through the window, the bacteria in the engine seems to glow as well. Becoming stars amongst the others.

Another shock. The draining of your blood seems to wane. Body grows limp and you feel your eyelids close. But the stars remain as you find yourself in the midst of the universe. One puddle of matter amongst the infinitely expanding.

It's strange, seeing all this as you still feel your body crumpling in on itself. As I feel pieces of myself being split and squeezed. There's an eternity of beauty before you, and you try to take it all in as you feel yourself fading.

When you begin to come back to consciousness, it's quickly clear you're no longer on the ship. There's a... silence, in your head. A pain at your temple. You can't hear CINDI. She must have been removed. Each limb creaks as you twitch them, bringing your body back to life. You find yourself slumped across a hard surface. Breathing in, the air tastes clean. Artificial. When you're ready, you [[open your eyes.]]

The room you're in is small. There's only one chair, a few steps away from you, and the ledge you're lying on. The clothes around your body are clean and soft. The Proxima insignia is marked on your shirt, and the door on the room's far side. There's a man, in the chair. Head down, pointed at a device, projecting images you can't see. He chuckles, lifting his head. Tight blond curls bouncing. It's Ezra Caval, from the briefing. From the memories. You [[sit up.]]

He hears your body shift, and looks up. A deep smile cracks open. "You're awake!" Standing, he walking closer. You see he's wearing what looks like track pants and a gym shirt, also with Proxima's X. "I was beginning to worry. You weren't doing too well, when we peeled you off the floor of that engine room / when we pulled you out of your sleeper."

//Another cage. He will not let you leave it, you know. Despite all you have done.//

"The Arks are getting prepared as we speak," continues Ezra. "You caught us off guard, got back sooner than expected. It's barely been three years, if you can't tell that kind of thing now.

"Oh, c'mon, $name. You know how this is, don't be an idiot. If you're worried about the continuation of the human race being a bunch of old white guys-- don't worry, we thought about all that. Put the time while you were away to good use. Some spots are subsidized, diversity and all that. We wanted to keep the gene pool as close to that of Earth as possible. The group we've put together... it's really an incredible assortment of individuals. The best of humankind." He chuckles to himself. "Ironic, isn't it? Because, well... you're not really human anymore, are you?"


"You're not going to make me pay for a spot on the ship I helped fuel, are you?"

"Oh, don't worry, $name. You'll be coming with us. You're mankind's hero, now. It's a... beautiful story, really. Your dad invented the engine that'll power us to salvation, and after his untimely death you went on an epic expedition to get enough fuel to save the species." He chuckles to himself. "Ironic, isn't it? Because, well... you're not really human anymore, are you?"

Crouching down, he's are now at your level. Trying to look through your eyes, not at them. "I know you're in there, whatever you are... I know you can understand me." His gaze shifts back into focus, to you. "You must be incredibly resilient, to resist it. Issac collapsed almost immediately. Don't get me wrong, your dad was brilliant, rest his soul. But he was so quick to trust. I'm... proud, that you were able to make the right choice."

(if you were always anti-microbe)
"That... might work. With you, as an exemplar for this concept. CINDI told me everything about your mission. How your commitment never wavered, even as you uncovered the memories I tried to hide. Having part-human hybrids running our Arks, it leaves us less vulnerable to any unforeseen problems with the fuel on its own. And... we have you, our first pilot."

//Joining with our kind does not make this any less violent. It does not make us any more willing. And I can attest, it does not make us loath you any less.//

He stands, and smiles down. "You're really lucky, you know that? I came in here planning to gas you back to sleep, stick you in a sleeper, and use you as an incubator when the day comes we run out of the fuel you brought back. I'm... really glad I don't have to do that."

With a pivot, he turns to walk away. "I'll leave you here until we're ready to begin preparations for boarding the Arks. In the meantime, I'll inquire about others who could be... convinced to be hosts, like you."

And with that he leaves, leaving you to sit in a cage, and [[wait.-&gt;Pilot Ship Epilogue]]

"Even you showed weakness. So many times. CINDI told me everything about your mission. Humans are built on empathy, and these parasites exploit that. Our engines work, no one needs to know at what cost. That's my burden to bare."

Ezra grows quiet, puts his head down for a moment. His face scrunched, as if he were flexing his muscles to try and remind himself what emotions look like.

"I came here for two things: the first is an apology. I never intended to completely erase your memories. Just... alter parts. You'd grown too sympathetic towards the fuel. Like your father. But your actions on this mission, following through even after discovering what I'd hidden, it shows I underestimated you. I'm sorry for that, too."

He stands back up, now, over you.

"The second is an explanation. We could have just left you unconscious, but I respect you enough I wanted to tell you -- face to face -- what it is we still need."

EDIT FOR RETURN W/O MICROBES


When you begin to come back to consciousness, it's quickly clear you're no longer on the ship. There's a... silence, in your head. A pain at your temple. You can't hear CINDI. She must have been removed. Each limb creaks as you twitch them, bringing your body back to life. You find yourself slumped across a hard surface. Breathing in, the air tastes clean. Artificial. When you're ready, you [[open your eyes.]]

The room you're in is small. There's only one chair, a few steps away from you, and the ledge you're lying on. The clothes around your body are clean and soft. The Proxima insignia is marked on your shirt, and the door on the room's far side. There's a man, in the chair. Head down, pointed at a device, projecting images you can't see. He tries to chuckle -- lifting his head, tight blond curls bouncing -- but its muffled in an odd bitterness. It's Ezra Caval, from the briefing. From the memories. You [[sit up.]]

He hears your body shift, and looks up. A deep smile cracks open. "You're awake." Standing, he walking closer. You see he's wearing what looks like track pants and a gym shirt, also with Proxima's X. "Finally. Almost thought you weren't going to make it. You weren't doing too well, when we peeled you off the floor of that engine room / when we pulled you out of your sleeper."

"The ones that made it back? They're fine. Stable. We're working on saving them from the radiation poisoning. Probably won't live out long and healthy lives, but they're not dying today. Joana... we're trying to understand what the fuck happened to her. But they're all safe. Don't know if I can say the same for you." He puts his fist up against a glass barrier between the two of you, and sees your eyes startle.

"You fucked up, $name. You didn't bring back what I asked for." He pulls back his hand, a print lingering.

//Another cage. He will not let you leave it, you know. Not after what you have done.//

"The Arks are getting prepared as we speak," continues Ezra. "You put us into a hopeful panic, when you came back so soon. It's barely been three years, if you can't tell that kind of thing now. We had everything lined up... passengers, already on their way from Earth and Mars, even Venus. They'll be here soon, demanding their salvation after the fortune each of them spent on a ticket... And what do I tell them? That our poster-boy Captain Silva came back a fucking bacteria-loving half breed?"

He's pacing, back and forth. Voice spiking and cracking.

"It's okay." Deep breaths break up his words. "There's a plan B. I made a plan B, as soon as I realized you fucked everything up." The pacing stops. "We only need one Ark, really. To keep the species alive. And for that... we can charge literally anything we want. Make up the costs for... everything. And if we only need to power one Ark... we only need a little bit of fuel." He turns to you.

"And look what we have: a specimen whose bloodstream is surging with those fuckers."

Crouching down, he's are now at your level. Trying to look through your eyes, not at them. "I know you're in there, whatever you are... I know you can understand me." His gaze shifts back into focus, to you. "You're fucking weak. To let that parasite take you over. Just like your dad. Issac collapsed almost immediately. Both of you... spineless."

"You want to see the shit we're dealing with? The apocalypse you could have saved us from? Look at it. Don't fucking turn away or I'll fill that cell with poisonous gas faster than you can blink."

It's hard to focus on the images, as they flash by one after the other. Skyscrapers turned to islands, tented shelters huddled against the storms. Then fires turning homes to a crisp. Diver swimming through an underwater city, tagging corpses. Skulls beaten open at the gates for a launch site. Bodies avalanching into ships. Families torn from one another.

It's a planet flooding in its own waste, its own wrath.

Now, everyone's going to think I'm just out here trying to save my own ass. It's not great optics, for me and a bunch of billionaires to run off, leaving everyone else behind.

"But fuck it. It's not like they'll be around that much longer to complain, right? Thanks to you. Bet you're really going to beat yourself up about that one." He stands, laughing.

She's terrified, not of what's on the other side of the door, but of who she will be when she walks back through it on her way out. There's something she feels, watching her, showing her the shapes of what this moment will make of her. It's nonsense, she thinks. Just nerves, and pushes those outlines away.

Taking a deep breath, she walks forward, the door moving to the side as she enters.

The room is simple. Half of a transparent cylinder creating a chamber on its far side. Inside, Issac. Drained and weak, the labcoat he's still wearing hanging to his thin body. Gray loops under his eyes. The scab at his temple, where his CINDI implant was removed before his placement in quarantine, only now beginning to rub off, leaving a thin scar behind.

"It's a beautiful cage you found for me," he says, looking up. "Spartan, but elegant, I suppose."

"It's a clean room, not a cage," she responds.

"Yes. Pristinely clean." There's a bitterness in his mouth, as he looks at his wife. "You're here to kill me, aren't you?"

Ana's paralyzed, mouth hanging open.

"You've run enough experiments to know you can't disentangle the bacteria from my bloodstream. I think I've made it clear I won't simply forget what I've learned, and neither will the microbes in my body. And the longer you try to keep me in this cage, the greater the chance this secret gets out."

He stands, moving closer to the glass.

"You can't find a way to disentangle us because there's nothing left to separate," he says. The bitterness leaves his voice. "We've... created something new, together. It's nothing to be mourned."

He laughs, quietly. "I could, you know. If you let me out. All it would take is some transfer of fluids, some contact between us, to share my microbiome with yours. And then you'd... see. Everything."

"It's not an infection. It's symbiosis. One of the most basic and natural tenants of biology." The condescension that sometimes colored Issac's tone begins to emerge. Now, it's hard for him to imagine not seeing these creatures as such. "But I understand. If our places were reversed, if this happened to you and not to me, I would probably say the same."


"You know I can't do that. Even if I wanted to, the moment I let you out, the guards monitoring this room would run in and force you back inside to contain your infection."

There's a focus in his eyes Ana's never seen before. A fixation and determination, as his eyebrows lean inward. As his eyes close and his fists begin to vibrate as his body begins to vibrate and there's a brief moment where his entire image is distorted, buzzing at a consistent frequency and the image slips into a point -- like those old TVs, flashing into a line into a dot and then into darkness -- and back out centimeters in front of Ana, just on the other side of the glass.

In a moment of silence, Ana stares at him in amazement and awe. His eyelids rise, a small smile lifting. Sirens blare as the moment passes, two armed members of Proxima's security rushing through the door, weapons raised.

"He knows. And if I... disappear, he'll know why too." Issac stands a bit taller, fists clenched. "But I don't plan on dying in a cage."

There's a focus in his eyes Ana's never seen before. A fixation and determination, as his eyebrows lean inward. As his eyes close and his fists begin to vibrate as his body begins to vibrate and there's a brief moment where his entire image is distorted, buzzing at a consistent frequency and the image slips into a point -- like those old TVs, flashing into a line into a dot and then into darkness -- and back out centimeters in front of Ana, just on the other side of the glass.

In a moment of silence, Ana stares at him in amazement and awe. His eyelids rise, a small smile lifting. Sirens blare as the moment passes, two armed members of Proxima's security rushing through the door, weapons raised.

[[Smile.]]
[[Don't smile.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1194" name="Smile." tags="" position="119960,160">Ana lets her lips crease up, ever so slightly, for Issac. "Why'd you bother convincing me to let you out, if you could've done that all along?"

"I wouldn't want to leave without you." Those enormous eyes open up to Ana, plucking at the strings of her heart that he knew could make you sing. Desperately hoping that instrument still worked. Was still in tune.

His gaze tears itself away and looks towards one of the guards. "If you're going to kill me, go ahead. I won't stop you. I only ask..." He turns back. "That you do it yourself." The words aren't of anger. "Because I can't do what you're asking of me. And I won't fight you."

Issac's lips tremble as he stands so close Ana can feel his cold breath fall on her cheek. It tastes metallic and familiar. Each breath soft, but... changed.

The words escape quietly, with just enough thrust to carry to the uniform-glad individuals behind you. Issac's smile falters, but his eyes remain open. Fixated on Ana as the two laser beams make contact with his chest. Inside them, you see a shattering. The strange horror of knowing one's death comes from the cowardice of another, and nothing more. And then they go dead, as the energy overloads his body and leaves it lifeless, falling back to the floor with a thud.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1197" name="Ask the guards for a weapon." tags="" position="120260,160">Ana stretches out a hand, back towards one of the guards. She doesn't take her eyes off Issac as the closest guard carefully places her weapon into Ana's fingers. It's light, she notices, as she brings it back to her side. As the second guard keeps his weapon upright, Ana brings the (space gun) to Issac's chest.

"I understand," he says with a small nod. "And I--" A smile breaks through. "You know all the rest," he finishes. Beaming at her, even as he feels the laser's barrel biting into his stomach.

The world around them grows quiet. The guards, lifting their weapons to fire. The siren. It all fades away as Issac wraps his arms around Ana and she around him and the bacteria laced throughout Issac's mind and body finds its way through his saliva to Ana's throat and down to her lungs and up through the neural pathways to her brain and by then

Issac's already shaking and space is already splitting and as Ana sees the beams of energy stretching out from the two guards, there's a slip and your parents are both gone.

After what seems like an eternity, Issac breaks from the kiss. He sees that they both slipped out of the quarantine room and into your quarters on the station. Safe, at least for now.

"That's the Dandara I fell in love with." He looks at Ana, as she begins to stabilize after the journey. She's confused, trying to come to terms with the new being lodging itself within her mind.

She sees the eyes of the armed guard rise through his mask, starting to lift his weapon, just before she fires, leaving him in a moment of shock before collapsing to the floor. Her momentum builds as Ana continues to swing about to the unarmed guard at the other corner of the room.

The confusion dips into horror. "I-- I'm starting to understand." She grows dizzy, processing the trauma unspooling out of Issac's invention.

There's a whoosh as the door to the room opens, and you enter your quarters. You're startled once you see them, first looking at your dad. "You're alive," you say, as you run to his arms, holding his fragile body. It had been months since you saw him, that day in the lab. You were unsure if you'd ever see him again.

 After the shock passes, you smile, and turn to your mom. "I thought you were going to do something horrible. And you didn't." 

"But I almost--"

"You didn't." Issac holds Ana's hand, gentle and firm.

His eyes glance up and meet yours. It's unnerving, watching this... other version of yourself through this shifting memory from your parents, carried through your connection to them. And, their connection to us as well.

Honestly, I don't quite understand how it all works. But it seems that your kind is far more connected than you like to think, if we can be here, sifting through the pasts of your parents. Creating new memories for this other version of you.

"What do we do now?" whispers Ana.

"We ensure that engine can never be used," says Issac. "That we never go to Proxima b, and harvest the rest of them for our machines." He looks at you. "There's... only one way to ensure that."

"You want to destroy the station." Ana walks back, letting Issac's hand fall back to his side.

"And all my research," he continues. "It's the only way."

"There's never only one way." Ana walks back, letting Issac's hand fall back to his side. "We could stop the mission, try explain--"

"I tried that, remember? And Ezra sent you to kill me."

"No, not like that. If everyone //understood,// in the way you understand, the way I am only beginning to..." She trails off.

"She means, if we infected the station," you say. "So everyone could hear them, like you."

There's an uneasiness that you see coming over you. Perhaps its because this version of you doesn't have one of my kind in your mind, but you can't help but think of what your mission always sought to achieve: safety, not violence.

"None of these plans help Earth." Issac and Ana turn as you speak. "Our mission has a goal that's worth keeping, even if we need to find a new way to accomplish it."

"Tell us what you're thinking, $name," says your mother.

"We could still go, using your symbiosis to guide us." You point to your father's head. "Together, you and the being speaking to you, lead the mission instead of me. We go to this place, and see if we can find some nonviolent way to coexist."

"We can survive, here. I believe that. We can find a way."

"No. We can't." Ana looks out the small window of the room, where a small cross-section of Saturn's rings sits splattered across the sky. "Survive where? There is no time left to save Earth. None of our colonies were built to accommodate a planet's worth of people." 

Ana thinks about how much of her life she's spent staring at this orb of gas and the chunks of ice and rock that surround it. How she can instantly describe each change in gradient from one ring to the next, but if asked to outline Earth's continents, would be unable to do so without a map. How she knew the topography of Mars in more detail than the coastline of Brazil where she was born.

"What I will never forget is the cold, gnawing at my bones, as my mother took us from Earth. The... chaos of making our way to Mars. The overcrowded ships and ports... and this was long before the worst of it. You never lived in that world, Issac. Of being unsure if there was space enough space in the universe for you to fit. Knowing the answer was no.

"We're out of space. We're out of time to find it. This isn't an endorsement of any choice over the other. But... we must be honest with ourselves, about what we're doing."

"We could live on the Arks," says Issac. "Live inside our own creations, instead of using them simply as transport. By refusing to to to Proxima b, we aren't condemning our own species to death."

"Not for certain. But we could be." Ana's words are firm. 

There's a moment of quiet, broken by a station-wide announcement, in CINDI's voice. "There has been a breach in security. A potential contingent is loose on the station. We recommend all Proxima personnel remain in their quarters during containment procedures." There isn't much time. You all know a choice must be made, soon.

"How do we know what's best?" you ask, looking to Issac. "You know these beings better than either of us."

"We're a family," says Issac, taking each of your hands. And as he does, you start to feel something else becoming present. Part of that is me, and this version of you, but something more. Something that ripples forward and back, as you hold the flesh of those that made you, touching the flesh of those that made them. "We have to make this decision together."

But, in this world... I don't think we ever meet. Not this version of me, or this version of you, at least. Already, I feel you-- us-- fading away.

I-- don't think I want to loose you. Not just yet, anyway.

You start to see that version of yourself. With your family, still alive. Struggling against the sprawling diaspora (?) fleeing Earth. / Struggling against your planet, consuming itself, but together.

Even the details of what happened as the station began to collapse into the ice are hazy, as we both start to fade away from a reality that's no longer our own.

It is decided. The station must be destroyed.

"We'll stay here," you tell me. "Remain and try to help both of us make sense of what we've done."

Sarah smiles. "You can't solve a problem you don't really understand."

//They are experiencing what you might called gratitude. And... surprise, that you choose to stay here willingly, after all they have seen you do both before and in possible afters of this moment.//

The pulsing begins to come back, very gradually. There's a sense of searching. Different than before, it's not being watched. It's prodding, but now with a greater sense of care.

Sarah's face convulses, bubbles escaping from her mouth. She's trying to laugh, under the water.

"What is it?" you ask.

"Oh nothing, it's just..." Her eyes look into yours, twinkling with an irony. "I've spent so much of my life looking through the lens of a microscope. Now, I feel like I'm on the other side. This all started because we found something we couldn't understand and put it into a container, believing that would lead us to answers. And... it's ending, in the same exact way."

[[It's what we deserve.]]
[[Maybe we'll learn something.]]

"I guess this is what we deserve."

"It's not about what we deserve or don't," says Sarah. "This is an opportunity to unlearn the systems that led us to come here, to assume that we have any right to pick apart whatever biology we happen to come across. Now, we get the chance to see what another form of life thinks of us."


"Now that we're on the other side, maybe we'll learn more than we did from your end of the microscope."

"I'm hoping it confirms a suspicion I've been developing that we might not need microscopes at all, to understand each other," says Sarah. "This is an opportunity to unlearn the systems that led us to come here, to assume that we have any right to pick apart whatever biology we happen to come across. Now, we get the chance to see what another form of life thinks of us."


The microbes don't say much, there's not much to translate. It's hard to say how long you've been there, under the water, as the time continues to pass. And the more time that passes, the more that length ceases to mean anything. The more it becomes one single moment, stretching out.

And that sensation begins to encompass more than just your time under the planet's surface. Slowly, everything starts to string itself together. The shards of memory you've been collecting. The scattered events since your arrival. And yet, there are still gaps. The question begins to make more sense, you see the gaps the microbes are searching for.

The moment grows deeper, and you attempt to focus. To look for something to fill in the gaps, but your senses aren't enough to make sense of what you're experiencing. You [[ask me]] to try and explain. I do my best.

//They are... looking for a place to land, one might say. Searching for a place deeper in your memory that touches the most of its other parts. In the same way when you arrived here, to this place of nonlinearity, your minds could only understand one specific place at a time. And each time you were dislodged, through dreams or memory, you found a different place to snap back to.

Now, as they sift through your linear understanding of your lives and histories, they search for a place that is most like our home: a place that isn't a line, that touches what came before and what is to come.//

(something that references the vignettes)

//Ah. I believe they have found something that shall suffice.//

One of the microbes ignites, directly in front of you, and comes forward. It moves slowly, leaving the circle, and stops at an arms length away.

//Go on, $name. Find us an answer. And, if you can, if Sarah's right... find us a way out of this.//

[[Reach out.]]

You stretch out your hand, and clasp the ball of light. It's soft and cold sends a surge of sensation through your fingers and there's the house, shivering against the end of the world.

Ana sat, huddled, with every blanket in the house piled on top of her as she flipped through the ancient flat-screen television, waiting for something to come in over the airwaves. There was only static. White and black pixels exploding back and forth, emitting a hiss that could barely be heard over the sounds of the blizzard outside. At least the snowstorm on the screen had the courtesy of being predictable. And of being able to be [[turned off.]]

Ana's mother pressed the switch on the remote, and the screen turns to black. "Nao tem nada, filha." / "There's nothing on, love."

"Televisao vai voltar? Quando o neve para?" / "Will the TV come back? When the snow stops?"

[[Eu acho que nao vai voltar.]] / [[Won't come back.]]
[[Vai voltar em poco tempo.]] / [[It'll be back, soon.]]

"Eu acho que nao vai voltar." / "I don't think it'll come back." She considers saying she doesn't know if the snow will stop. But there's no reason to scare her more than she already has been.

"Vai voltar em poco tempo." / "It'll be back, soon." In truth, she doesn't know even if the snow will stop. But there's no reason to scare her more than she already has been.


Ana's face falls. "E o Amarizio? Ele vai voltar de Natal, ne?" / "And Amarizio? He's coming back from Natal, right?"

He should have come back almost a week ago. Proxima was offering safe passage to Mars for families that were willing to help them build their new paradise, he went to the closest launch site, near a city called Natal in the northeast. He was just old enough to work, and their mother still had some good working years left. And, soon, Ana would grow up.

But they had heard nothing. All connectivity was down, with the storm. They could only wait.

[[Eu nao sei.]] / [[I don't know.]]
[[Tem certeza ele e quasi aqui.]] / [[I'm sure he's almost here.]]

"Eu nao sei." / "I don't know." The words hurt, not just for the fear of loosing her son, but the price of honesty she found from the wounds her daughter's distant look of panic gave her. (fix this)

"Fala um estoria para mim, mae. Por favor. Quando nos estamos esperando ele." She buries herself further in her blankets and looks up, longing for something besides fleece and polyester to hold onto in all her fear. "Me conte de novo, a estora de Dandara."


"Tem certeza ele vai virar a esquina em qualquer momento!" / "I'm sure he'll be around the corner at any moment!" The lie hurt, not just because it further repressed her own fears of loosing her son, but the smile she saw in her daughter she was almost certain would turn sour, once the hope was revealed to be false.

"Mais, ate ele chega, eu quero um estoria." / "But, until he gets back, I want to hear a story." She sits up on the couch, bringing the blankets closer around her, the fleece and polyester doing their best to keep her warm. "Me conte de novo, a estora de Dandara!"


"Dandara? A estoria de Ana Dandara e um menina que nao precisa ficar com tao medo." / 
"Dandara? The story of Ana Dandara is that she was a girl who didn't need to be so scared by a bit of snow and wind."

"Eu nao tem medo!" / "I'm not scared!" She throws her hands up, sending the blankets flying, in defiance at the thought. "Mais eu estou falando de a gueirrera Dandara. Quero este estoria." / "But I'm talking about the warrior Dandara. I want that story."

"Ah, mais voce nao tem medo. Voce e muito velha agora. Esse foi a estoria eu falei quando estava criancinha, indo para cama. Achou que voce nao vai gostar agora." / "Oh, but you're too old now. Nothing can scare you. This was the story I told you when you were small, when I wanted to put you to sleep. I think you won't like it anymore, now."  She could tell the tease already had her hooked.

"Por favor, mae! Fala para mim. Voce pode... alterar, amplificar algumas coisas, agora eu sou mais velha. Fala mais detalhes, para ficar como as estorias dos adultos." / "Please, mom! Tell it to me. You can... change some things, now that I'm older. Add more details, then it'll be like a grown up story."

"Voce quer a estoria completo?" / "You want the grown up version?" Ana notices her tone shifts. Grows serious. A little bit sad. She wasn't expecting that.

"Sim," / "Yes," she replies quietly. A little scared.

"Ta bom." / "Alright." She sits on the couch, next to her daughter, facing her and the bundle of blankets. "Escuche bem." / "Listen well."

The wind howls and the house shakes. Her words take over.

&lt;center&gt;[[---&gt;Final Memory: The Story]]&lt;/center&gt;

"This isn't an easy story to tell. It's... hard to know, how much to say. No one knows if Dandara was born here, or taken and brought here. Really... either way, she was brought here. We all were. To... build this place. / "Esse estoria nao e facio te contar. E... dificil saber, se e melhor contar tudo ou nao. Ningem sabe se Dandara naceu aqui, ou foi trazido. Em qualquer jeito, ela foi atrazio. Como todos nois. Para... criar esse lugar.

"Brazil wasn't always called Brazil. This land was a place before it was a country. There are languages much older than this Portuguese we're speaking. Buildings here long before the oldest churches. People here before the Portuguese that claimed to find this land. I know you know some of this. But there's... more." /  "Brasil nao foi chamado Brasil sempre. Esse terra foi um lugar antes de um pais. Tive linguas aqui muito mais velho dess Portuguese nois estamos falando. Tenemos edificios aqui antes de as ingrejas mais velhas. Povos aqui antes de os Portuguese que fala discobriu esse terra. Eu sei voce sabe muinto isso. Tem mais..."

There's the tumbling sound of water rushing up and then receding, forward and back. Soft and constant. Dynamic but patterned.

"Those indigenous people... were forced to begin transforming their land. To take the sugar and gold from its veins back across the sea for profit. And when they weren't enough... the Europeans stole people. / "Aqueles povos indigenas foi... forcado transformar seus terras. Para tirar acucar e ouro de as veias e trazer ao outro lado do mar para o lucro. E quando eles nao deu... os Europeus robou pessoas."

There are the sounds of those chains again. Slow and methodical from the recesses of your ear. A pulse, from which all else seems to be born.

"They... rewrote the world. With the blood of our ancestors." / "Eles... reescreveu o mundo. Com sangue de nossas antepassos."

And the screams of Atlantic storms, mixing with the blizzard outside Ana's home, mixing with the hum of your underwater enclosure.

"This is what our land is soaked in. This is what we are bathed out of. Sometimes, I don't know what to do with that... but it's a truth. And it's the truth Dandara was born into, whether that was hear or across the ocean in Africa. It's the truth that gave birth to her home: Palmares."

There's music, too. Out of all these sounds, and more. Rhythm and flow. Movement and strength.

"But you don't understand any of this...  I'll start at the right place." / "Mais voce ainda nao indente nada... eu vou comencar no lugar correto."

Remember why we're here, $name. Find the best place to help us understand.

The oceans storm, calms. The rattling of chains hushes to near silence. Instead, there's the calm lapping of waves against shore. The shine of sun against sand.

"


Foi perto de pascal, se eu lembra correto. Minhas aulas de historia sao dificil lebrar. Mais tem um monte chamado monte pascal, porque isso foi a primeria coisa os exploradores Portugueses viram quando eles checou perto da terra." / "It was close to Easter, if I remember correctly. My history lessons are hard to remember, now... But there was a mountain called Monte Pascal, because this was the first thing the Portuguese explorers saw when they got close to these shores."

The seaweed is the first sign of land. Brown and red and tangled, it shines through the bright and blue waters with clarity. You feel some part of yourself, swaying unsteadily, gut in turmoil, staring down at it. Knotted and networked and a sign: land is close.

"They see that mountain and then they see the shore. Paradise, it seems to be. As they approach, they begin to see figures on the sand. Looking back."

She first sees the strange blemishes on the horizon. Small. Unidentifiable. And then  they approach. Thirteen hulking masses of wood and tarp and people, dancing across its surface stringing it with rope and they stop. Some ways off from your shore.

"They send one small boat to them, with one man."

Nicolau Coelho stumbles out of the small boat when he reaches the shore, the water dampening his boots as he gets out. He fumbles to hold onto a large and elegant black hat, keeping it on his head, as he approaches the twenty or so individuals in front of him. A red cape trailing behind, its cusp caught by the waves once or twice.

You feel your feet soggy with the salty seawater and dry against the sun-kissed sand. And, still, you hear Ana's mother, telling this story. There's a splitting headache searing across your forehead, as you try and keep all these images together. And then it occurs to you, you're not even sure where your forehead is anymore.

[[This isn't like the other memories.]]
[[This hurts. Make it stop, please.]]

"This isn't like the other memories," you think to me. "What's... happening?"

"This hurts. Make it stop, please," you think to me. But I think you know, I can't start what's already begun. "What's... happening?"

Exactly what you see before you.

The others have gathered by the time he arrives. She's ready, stretching back the string on her bow as the man finds his way out of the large canoe he crawls out of. The others do as well. His hands fly up, his face a mix of fear and calm.

"He arrives on the shore, faced with the hesitant curiosity of those he saw from the ships."

Surrounded. Sharp arrows, pointed at him. He keeps his face calm. No sudden movements, no ill intent seen beneath his eyes. Slowly, he brings his hands to the ground. Repeating this motion. His eyes reaching out to as many as he can find.

The man stares at her. Eyes hinting at fear, but not the kind you think will harm you. The others, you notice, begin to lower their weapons. She begins to lower hers as well. They ask questions he can't answer. He asks questions they can't answer.

His words are useless, he finds quickly. But that is to be expected. The only gifts he has, he leaves his hat and trailing cape. In turn, they



You're not there, not really. You know this. You can't be. And yet... it seems as if the woman catches your eye, as the tip of her arrow begins to move towards the ground. There's... something you do feel, that's there... flowing within her veins. Something within her gut within your bones that echoes back... distant. Perhaps the trick of a sideways glance that's just coincidence.

But you sense you are not just an observer, here. That there is something more.

"



The tides rise and waters violently call for Coelho to return, lest his boat be lost. He leaves his gifts to return. She and the others remain, speaking words you don't understand but feel like you might, if you were watching all this from some other angle.

The scene melts away and reconstructs itself anew. It is the next day, and the ships have found shelter from the turbulent waters in a natural harbor. Two 



This too, melts. It is a week since the first sight of the ships.

There is a sawing that naughts at her ears. Teeth against bark. And the slow whistle of a trunk's collapse. They are sounds that have not been heard on this shore before, not like this. Not with the calculated precision of instrumentation. Of metal daggers to chew at the jungle's flesh.

It is a week and two days since the first sight of the ships. On the shore of what will now be named Porto Seguro there sits a towering shape. It is crafted of sharp and rectangular wood. Bolted together with small daggers. One pillar to the sky, the other shorter. Crossed just above its midpoint.

A cross. It stands tall. And the white men lower their heads to it and whisper to themselves and motion for those of you witnessing this transformation from tree to tower to join. And they do, quietly, confusedly. But with curiosity.

And then they leave, the next day. Carrying some sense of you along with them.

Oh if only they never returned.
Thank goodness they one day returned.

It wasn't always like this.

There was a time, before these words were spoken on this land. Before these names were assigned to these places. 

They were people









They found this place by accident. 


Setting up churches, taking the wood they found here... 

They forced the indigenous peoples they found to do these jobs for them. Forced them... raped them. And 







There's a new kind of line you start to feel. A string, sewn through the woman on the shore, through you -- in the water, but not just there. You -- cradled in your mothers arms above Mars. Your mother -- cradled in her mother's arms as snow falls on sand. The sand -- feeling the first boots imprint themselves on its moist surface. Feeling chains dragged across the minuscule rocks that outnumber the stars. The stars -- watching and waiting to see how you will ever reach them. Over whose bodies. Our bodies -- surrounding you, as you see all this. This -- how we understand our world, now how you understand yours.

And the string running through all these things continues until it connects back and it all begins to vibrate. The motions of each echoing across to the other in waves. They all echo the same frequency: its tune riddles in pain, echoing forward and back. The hum under everything that led to you being brought into this world and everything moving forward.

It feels as if this particular string wouldn't exist without it.

I think they have their answer, now. They see the completeness of your history, how this violence you have enacted upon us had its seed planet long ago and long into your future. Though we still shall feel this pain, now at least they shall understand it.

The words are light, and fall softly on her daughter's ears. Ana's smile warms the room. "They defended Palmares, and they won. Not just that day, but for all days."

You see it. Less clearly now, but you feel something sweep across the string. Disjointing everything, but only for a moment, as the new music continues forward.

"It wasn't easy, but it was always possible. That the evil could be undone. Dandara's story was only one of many, of those that pushed against the lives they were born into. And... created new worlds."

No more clanking of chains. Instead, the strumming of music. The shuffling of leaves. Pain and conflict, yes. But of a different kind.

"You wanted to know the story of Dandara, of your name. She was the warrior that made a Quilombo of Brazil for us all." 

--

"Que estoria boinitinha!" / "What a beautiful story!" Amarizio's voice floats in through an open window. The storm has stopped. The snow is gone.

"Irmao!" / "Brother!" Ana jumps off the couch and runs outside to meet him. You watch, as she launches herself into his arms. They both are knocked back into what before was the white static of the snowstorm, but now... it's hard to tell. Just light, blinding.

As you look into it, trying to make out what lies beyond, everything begins to fade. You're left with shapes, outlines. Nothing more. But... everything's changed. That much is clear.

We don't exist, in that place. Not you and me, together, like this. Perhaps there's versions of us, if Ana still grows up to meet someone named Issac. On Earth, on Mars... who knows. But if I had to guess, I'd say you don't come to our planet to meet me. Or if so, in a very different manner.

The others are gone, too. The last I felt from them was a sense of utter shock and surprise. Some disbelief, that you could change all this. Just after they began to understand. And then... it was silence. It's clear there's no tunnel burrowing down through our planet, anymore. No congress of judgment upon your people.

[[What happens now?]]

"What happens to us now?"

I don't know. I'm not omnipotent. I'm just the narrator, telling this story with you.

[[Find out together.]]
[[Finding out now.]]

We'll find out together, then, won't we?

I think we're finding out right now.

We're... fading, I think. From existence. We switched too many tracks and ended up somewhere inbetween, missing our ride. But that's okay. Everyone's getting to where they need to go. That's... what matters.

How do you end these stories of yours? Does someone always always show up at the window to interrupt? Perhaps we keep going until that happens. If we had a door, that is. If we had a room or a place to be in order to have a door.

I'm... scared. I never thought about... dying, before meeting you. I-- don't think I want to loose you. Not just yet, anyway.

Here, at the end, I see you. For the first time, I think.

I see all the possible versions of you, of us. Worlds that could have been. Some, terrifying. Others, beautiful. Most are in between. And I... miss all of them, all at once. As I see us fading away.

Each and every one of you I know is still with me. Will be with me, a part of me. And yet, there is something about linearity, about the end of a line, even as it branches and loops and ends and begins. There's a profound sadness to what you call death. 

[[Hold onto me.-&gt;Hold onto me change]]
[[Let me go.-&gt;Let me go change]]


"Hold onto me," you whisper. Without a mouth. Without breath. Somehow, it's still a whisper.

And I try. I'm... starting to see the fraying, at the end of this line you've taken us on. The split ends that begin to double back. There's possibility, filtered between these shapes.

I'm grabbing at these split ends, even as they fade, hoping there's an answer that doesn't leave us so completely erased as we have been now. These words... that have birthed a new world, while taking away ours... I wonder if they could have the power to bring us back.

There's something magnificent about the ability of words to tell a story. To bring something to life with these utterances alone. That's one of the few parts I've truly loved about meeting you... the way linearity can create narrative. One action leading to another, preserving and carrying forward the pieces that make us what we are.

But, at least as I see them in your head, they always seem to end. Perhaps that's necessary... but I'm not convinced.

I don't want to fade away. Even if this world we created is better, for whoever gets to live in it. I want to be... carried forward. I want us to hold onto this story. 

Do you want to tell this story, with me, again? As we fend of the abyss together? To find a future that doesn't leave us strangers adrift in the multiverse, destined to never meet, if we even still exist at all. Unless that's where you wish to leave it.

(if good rel)
I know I don't... I want to find a way to stay with you.

(if bad rel)
I know I don't... As I see the edges of the yous that could have been, the ones I could love, I want to find a way to them.

But between, there's the strip of continuous sunset. Where the roots can lace themselves carefully throughout, protruding into magnificent trees branching towards the skies. Where waves lap up against a rocky shore and molecules germinate into life that trillions of years later will whither up in the slow and cool demise of its host star, unable to supply the energy to feed us but it's okay because it's the same moment of our birth, on the rocks, where we will soon be sewn throughout this place.

But most survive. In shock of the journey on which they were about to embark, grateful to now understand, to be pulled back from the edge.

There's still the fear</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1229" name="old stuff" tags="" position="123660,160">You remember nothing?"

"No, I... I don't." Issac's eyes seemed lost, unsure of where to look. "Is there... I'm hearing a noise. Are you hearing a noise, Ana?"

"What kind of noise?" Ana looked concerned.

"I'm not sure, it's... it's nothing." He looked down. "I think just a ringing in my ears, must have been left over from almost drowning."

"This will all be over soon, I promise."

"When can I get out of here?"

"I'll be honest, I don't know. No one has ever made contact with one of them."

"I'm fine, Ana. Really. I'm fine."

"I know you are. We just have to wait long enough... to be sure."

Issac stepped away from the glass. He knew that was the best answer he was going to get. "Okay."

"I should let you rest." Ana reached out to Issac with her eyes, as if to caress him and sooth him and tell him everything was going to be alright. She could do that with a look. "It's really great to see you. Breathing, that is." 




She laughed, easing the tension, and Issac laughed too and for a brief moment it seemed like everything could still be alright. But, somewhere inside, they both knew it couldn't be. They ignored those parts of themselves, however, so they could have one smile from each other. And each soaked up the joy of the other. "Goodnight, Issac."

"Goodnight, dear wife."

She left, and Issac lay down for a restless night. In his dreams, or what he thought were his dreams, one of my kind spoke to him in the way I spoke to you. Told him of our pain. Our power. The fullness of our complexity, of our lives. That one could easily argue we are not only your equals, but superiors. And Issac thought it was a nightmare, until he awoke and the voice didn't go away. He howled and howled in pain. Feeling what he had done for the first time. And we cried out as well, learning of the pain of your people. The way your planet, Earth, had been destroyed. How there were too many of your people and too few places to call home. How your people didn't understand what you had done. And we felt Issac's grief at this realization, and this brought us comfort.

Remember all these feelings were new. None of us knew even the idea of "comfort" before that day. We never knew the concept of "pain" before we were thrown into your machines. And after this, our first contact with one of your kind, we were overcome with... feeling. With thought and images and space. To be clear, we had all of this, but in our own way. Not with the rawness of your kind. But in all this... newness, the pain and pleasure that came with it, we found hope in this empathy. And it was in that we placed our trust. Your father and... perhaps it would be easiest to describe as my brother, or sister, let us say sibling if you will. The two of them came to an agreement: Issac would explain the nature of the fuel cells torturing my brethren. And all would be at peace.



Ana came back the next morning, concerned. Issac's neural activity that night had been off the charts. The blood samples they'd analyzed showed materials completely foreign to your kind. When she came back to him, Issac appeared to her to be in a feverish state.

He stood when he saw her. "Ana! You're back. Please, I know this is going to sound strange, but we need to stop the MFC production, all the research, all the prototypes, the whole energy grid. We need to stop it right now." 

"Issac, you're not well. Please, calm down."

"No, no, Ana. Really, it's okay. I'm okay. The microbe, that I made contact with? It's here, it's in me. And it told me-- a lot. I can explain everything once the grid is shut down."

"We can't just shut down the grid, you know that. The MFC's power... everything on the station."

"Trust me, Ana. Please just do as I say."

"No. Issac, your brain activity has been all over the place, you're clearly delirious--"

He raised his voice. "I'm not delirious! You don't understand, you have to shut them--"

"Issac, settled down, you--"

"I'm fine. We'll be fine, just activate the back-up generators, that'll--"

"You know those will only last for a couple weeks, maybe a month."

"More than enough time to--"

"Issac. Stop this. What on Earth is this all about?"

"It's the microbes. They're not... they're alive."

"Of course they're alive."

"No, no. I mean they're... //alive//. They can think, they're intelligent, they can communicate. The sample I touched, it can talk with me. We've been... talking. Ana, it's... it would be wonderful, but right now it's actually quite terrible. They're in pain, Ana. Truly terrible pain."

"You're not thinking str--" Issac shook his head with vigor.

"No. Let me speak." A command, not a statement. "My engine. When we put them in those machines, it's like torture. It's hard to explain-- they're not like us. But what the devices do to them, it's as if we were to be squeezed into a paste. Over and over again, squeezed and unsqueezed to just be squeezed again, until we die. Every time one of those cells dies, that's a living, thinking being. If we use it, the way we intend, we will be committing genocide, Ana. We can... //never// use that engine. We have to destroy it."

Ana was stunned. She had never seen Issac like this. "You're not well, Issac. You're--"

"I am well!" he shrieked, then speaking slowly, looking directly into her eyes. "I have never been better in my life."

"You will let me speak. As I let you speak." Her voice became gravely. "You have been contaminated with an alien substance. And now, you're asking me to destroy the greatest technological advancement of the century, that //you// created, the technology that will enable us to evacuate this system and save our species. I'm not sure if you understand, but without that engine, there will be no way to accommodate 

 It is our only chance at a future. And you expect me to just turn it off because you're getting hallucinations and fever dreams? These are microbes we are talking about. Microscopic organisms, quite literally the simples, most basic, unintelligent forms of life that exist. They cannot feel pain. They cannot feel joy. They cannot communicate. It is clear, however, that they can cause sever damage to human physiology and psychology." Her severity turned to pain. "Damage I sincerely hope can be reversed."

Issac's face was red with anger. "Are you done?"

"Yes." She nodded. "I'm done."

"There's someone who wants to talk to you." Issac looked scared as he closed his eyes, and breathed out. His body jolted to the side and went limp for a moment. Slowly, it picked itself up, finding a perfect posture. Eyes still closed, Issac's body spoke. But it was not his voice.

"These-- words. They are new to me." The voice spoke far slower and in an accent far stranger than Ana had ever heard. It was as if someone was learning to use a tongue for the first time. Indeed, that's exactly what was happening. But, their words were clear and they were understood. "I shall do-- my best."

Ana was horrified. Watching the body of her husband be contorted to use someone else's words. "Issac, please stop this. This isn't funny. This isn't... just stop." Water was welling in her eyes.

"You are the one this one loves. This, too, is new to us. Not completely foreign, but this particular manner of care. There is a beauty in it. I hope it will help you understand."

"Issac..." Every time she spoke his name, the more she felt he was gone. "Please..."

"My -- people. We are connected. When one of what you call an individual microbe dies, it is as if a piece of ourselves is taken away. Ripped away. We feel this every instant, now that you use us this way. I feel it in this moment. I do not remember what it was like not to feel it. I want to be clear -- we are each our own. Separate. Independent. But still connected. Still can -- feel one another. Your words are not -- good for explaining this. Or -- many other things."

"Give me back my husband."

"First, I need you to -- understand. Who we are. How you hurt us."

"I don't care. Give me back my husband, or I swear I will kill you both right now."

Issac's body hesitates for a moment, and goes limp again. Issac's eyes open.

"Issac." She sighed in relief. "We have to find a way to get that... thing out of your body."

"I don't want it out of my body. I want all of them out of our power conduits."

"It still isn't you, is it?"

"Yes, Ana. It is me. It's precisely because I am myself that I cannot abide the way of life we have built here."

"No... no this isn't you. This is that... thing parading as you. Wearing you like a glove, to try and get to me."




"Ana, please. Look into my eyes." She looked. "This is me. I promise you. Me, Issac Alexander. Wife to Ana Dandara de Silva. Who misses the child we created together very, very much." A tear drizzled down his face as he smiled. "And who very much does not want that child to grow up in a world powered by the genocide of an intelligent, self-aware form of life."

"I wish I could believe that. I wish I could believe... any of this, Issac."

"But you believe enough of it, don't you? Enough to entertain the possibility that I'm right?"

"I believe that these microbes are more advanced than we had thought. Parasitic, perhaps. I believe they want something from us. That our fuel cells do... something to them. And I know my husband is dead."

"How can you say that when I'm right here? I'm right here, Ana."

"No. Right now, at least, you're gone." Ana buried her pain, turned, and left.

She spent the next months conducting experiments, on the microbes, on him, trying to find some way to separate one from the other. But always sending in one of the few other scientists aware of the situation. In her mind, Issac was infected. Diseased. Victim to some parasitic virus. But of course, there was no cure because there was no sickness. As you know.








Ana returned to the quarantine chamber one last time, after all hope of somehow reversing this joining was lost.

"You've returned." Issac was sitting inside the chamber. "Run out of tests?"

"There doesn't seem to be a way to cure you."

"That's because I'm not sick."

"No. It's because my husband truly is gone."

Issac stands. "I concede on one point. I have changed, that is true. Through this... contact. But I am still Issac. I'm something more, too. Perhaps shifted in some ways. But in no way I have not wished. Ana, this has been my life's dream. One I thought would never be possible. To make contact with other life. To talk with it, live with it! I have done what so few have been able to do: touch the unknown, and let it become known. And for that you reject me. Issac is here, alive. What he joined with is also here, alive.

"Just because you can latch onto a human body and bastardize its form, learn to imitate its speech, its movements, that does not make you equally alive. You are a parasite! Less than an amoeba."

"Forget about what I am. Despise me, if you will. But what has happened here must show you that the microbes you exploit are far more complex, far more alive than you thought. I ask you again: shut down the power grid." The voice both was and wasn't Issac. A more focused, more determined version of himself.

"I will not." This Issac was foreign to Ana.

"This is nothing less than genocide. Continuous torture. These are concepts we did not even have words for before we met your people."

"Those words were never meant to describe organisms only even visible under a microscope."

"Why is it so hard for you? To entertain the possibility of finding another way?" In his pleading, Ana saw more of the Issac she knew. She wished she didn't.

"There is no other way. Humanity was on the brink of desperation, and now we have a fighting chance. I will not take that away."

"You think the survival of our race is worth this price?" This was him, that even she could see.

"The price of a few thousand dead cells a day? Yes. Yes, I do. That's about what my skin sheds every tenth of a second."

"And what if... what if there's even a chance you're wrong?"

"And what if I don't give a damn?" Her eyes bore into him.

"You're going to kill me. Aren't you?" Issac had a moment of terror. But then peace. "I can already see it. See all the different ways you might do it. I'm right, aren't I?"

He looked up to her, and found her in silence.

"I understand. You haven't found some way to cure me from the disease you believe I have, to separate the microbe from who I was. You can't simply let me go. There's too much at stake if enough people came to believe my words. And you can't keep me here forever."

"My husband is gone. You are not him. And whatever you are, I know you are a threat."

"I understand. But before you do this thing, I would like to see my child. One last time."

"You know I can't do that."

"I know. But you know I had to ask."

"Is there anything else you wish to say?"

"I do have one request. Now, I'm speaking to the part of you that isn't lying to yourself. The part that knows I am Issac. That knows I am telling the truth. That knows the profound evil of what you're about to do. What you have done. What you will continue to do. I know you are not powerful enough you change your own mind. I only ask you this." Issac goes down to his knees. "Please, give me the respect to kill me yourself. With your own hand. Not to poison me with an injection or gas. Or electrocute me. Or wait until I sleep. Kill me yourself. Don't let anyone else do it for you."

The words hung in the air, as if they lingered, to see what would happen, and couldn't float off like words are supposed to until they did. There was a thickness to the room. As Ana turned towards the control panel on the opposite side of the room, it seemed as if she was walking through molasses, or an invisible fog. From her finger print, a compartment opened, and a small firearm was revealed within. With another button, the barrier surrounding Issac rotated swiftly to one side. She took the firearm, and turned.

Her approach was slow, taking measured steps. The gun in her hand pointed towards her husband. Three steps was all it took, and she was there. The tip of the gun pressed against Issac's head.

She was trembling. "I've... never killed anyone before."

Issac looked up at her with eyes, round with sadness. "Yes. Yes you have."

The trigger was pulled. A laser bore a hole through the center of Issac's brain, clean, with little blood. And again, his body fell limp onto the floor.


















"Ana... this is not the way this has to be. If you could only let me out of this cage, we could fix this. I'm... communicating with them. We're learning about each other, I'm discovering the pain we've caused, and they are beginning to understand the desperation that forced us to this point.

There are endless possibilities. If we could talk to (??), get him to listen...

.. He won't listen.

... then damn him! We don't need him. This is our mission, we decide whether it flies or not. And on whose terms. I'm not talking about leaving our people to die. I'm talking about helping our people understand. Perhaps, together, we could go on this mission, talk to the rest of their kind on Proxima, and come to an agreement.

I wish I could... share this with you. Help you understand.

You'd want to infect me?

It's not an infection. It's symbiosis. One of the most basic and natural tenants of biology. Perhaps... we've thought of it all wrong. Maybe we don't even need the fuel. What if these bacteria could help us breathe in the Earth's dirty air? Or the (??) of Titan, the (??) on Mars?

(response of wtf, they'd never go for it)

Perhaps your right. Perhaps now that this ship has been made, a destination set, it's too late... All I know is this mission, as it is designed cannot be allowed to take place. If you let me out of here, we can decide how best to move forward.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1230" name="Issac and Ana to adapt" tags="" position="123710,110">After this, the conversation transitions into the player asking about their father, why the microbe made it seem like they might be their father, and asking what happened.


"I... thought you were my dad. Somehow, that he was still alive."

"I'm sorry I led to that impression. It was not my intent to deceive. However, I do know what happened to your father."

"I do too. He died, on an expedition in the ocean. And it has something to do with that formation."

"He survived."


Microbe tells player that their father survived, made contact with one of their kind like you have, and was also put into quarantine when they came back. Then, transitions to showing the player what happens directly.



She let go of the tears she had held back when Issac awoke. "Thank god. I thought -- I thought I'd lost you."

"I'm right here, Ana. I'm right here." Issac stood and walked towards here, but was stopped when he hit the glass of the quarantine chamber. "Where am I?"

"You're on the station. You're safe." She smiled at him.

"I'm in a cage, aren't I?"

"It's not a cage, just a quarantine room. Normal procedure, you'll be out soon."

"What happened to me?"

"You, well... we're not sure. It looks like you came into contact with one of the samples."

"Yes, I... I did, didn't I? It's starting to come back."

"Is there anything else you remember?"

"I remember... I was preparing to leave, to ascend back to the surface. I hit something, one of the rock formations, and... one of the samples came loose."

"Yes, yes that's right."

"And I grabbed it. I didn't mean to... I was trying to put everything back. Put a cap on things..."

"What do you remember after that?"

"Something... happened. I sent a signal for help, the sub was taking on water, there was... some circle... inside the sub but also outside. I don't know how to explain it..."

"The video footage we looked over is... well, it's nonsense. Everything's out of order, or crowded with static."

"How did you save me?"

"We sent one of the androids down to get you. The sub was fully flooded but it was able to pull you out, place a resporater on your mouth, and pull you up to the surface. It's propulsion easily carried you in the low gravity. But you were down there for... hours before we got to you. I don't know how you're alive, frankly. You remember nothing?"

"No, I... I don't." Issac's eyes seemed lost, unsure of where to look. "Is there... I'm hearing a noise. Are you hearing a noise, Ana?"

"What kind of noise?" Ana looked concerned.

"I'm not sure, it's... it's nothing." He looked down. "I think just a ringing in my ears, must have been left over from almost drowning."

"This will all be over soon, I promise."

"When can I get out of here?"

"I'll be honest, I don't know. No one has ever made contact with one of them."

"I'm fine, Ana. Really. I'm fine."

"I know you are. We just have to wait long enough... to be sure."

Issac stepped away from the glass. He knew that was the best answer he was going to get. "Okay."

"I should let you rest." Ana reached out to Issac with her eyes, as if to caress him and sooth him and tell him everything was going to be alright. She could do that with a look. "It's really great to see you. Breathing, that is." She laughed, easing the tension, and Issac laughed too and for a brief moment it seemed like everything could still be alright. But, somewhere inside, they both knew it couldn't be. They ignored those parts of themselves, however, so they could have one smile from each other. And each soaked up the joy of the other. "Goodnight, Issac."

"Goodnight, dear wife."

She left, and Issac lay down for a restless night. In his dreams, or what he thought were his dreams, one of my kind spoke to him in the way I spoke to you. Told him of our pain. Our power. The fullness of our complexity, of our lives. That one could easily argue we are not only your equals, but superiors. And Issac thought it was a nightmare, until he awoke and the voice didn't go away. He howled and howled in pain. Feeling what he had done for the first time. And we cried out as well, learning of the pain of your people. The way your planet, Earth, had been destroyed. How there were too many of your people and too few places to call home. How your people didn't understand what you had done. And we felt Issac's grief at this realization, and this brought us comfort.

Remember all these feelings were new. None of us knew even the idea of "comfort" before that day. We never knew the concept of "pain" before we were thrown into your machines. And after this, our first contact with one of your kind, we were overcome with... feeling. With thought and images and space. To be clear, we had all of this, but in our own way. Not with the rawness of your kind. But in all this... newness, the pain and pleasure that came with it, we found hope in this empathy. And it was in that we placed our trust. Your father and... perhaps it would be easiest to describe as my brother, or sister, let us say sibling if you will. The two of them came to an agreement: Issac would explain the nature of the fuel cells torturing my brethren. And all would be at peace.

[[Your people brainwashed him.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1231" name="What happened next?" tags="" position="123860,160">"What happened next?"

Ana came back the next morning, concerned. Issac's neural activity that night had been off the charts. The blood samples they'd analyzed showed materials completely foreign to your kind. When she came back to him, Issac appeared to her to be in a feverish state.

He stood when he saw her. "Ana! You're back. Please, I know this is going to sound strange, but we need to stop the MFC production, all the research, all the prototypes, the whole energy grid. We need to stop it right now." 

"Issac, you're not well. Please, calm down."

"No, no, Ana. Really, it's okay. I'm okay. The microbe, that I made contact with? It's here, it's in me. And it told me-- a lot. I can explain everything once the grid is shut down."

"We can't just shut down the grid, you know that. The MFC's power... everything on the station."

"Trust me, Ana. Please just do as I say."

"No. Issac, your brain activity has been all over the place, you're clearly delirious--"

He raised his voice. "I'm not delirious! You don't understand, you have to shut them--"

"Issac, settled down, you--"

"I'm fine. We'll be fine, just activate the back-up generators, that'll--"

"You know those will only last for a couple weeks, maybe a month."

"More than enough time to--"

"Issac. Stop this. What on Earth is this all about?"

"It's the microbes. They're not... they're alive."

"Of course they're alive."

"No, no. I mean they're... alive. They can think, they're intelligent, they can communicate. The sample I touched, it can talk with me. We've been... talking. Ana, it's... it would be wonderful, but right now it's actually quite terrible. They're in pain, Ana. Truly terrible pain."

"You're not thinking str--" Issac shook his head with vigor.

"No. Let me speak." A command, not a statement. "The microbial fuel cells. When we put them in those machines, it's like torture. It's hard to explain-- they're not like us. But what the devices do to them, it's as if we were to be squeezed into a paste. Over and over again, squeezed and unsqueezed to just be squeezed again, until we die. Every time one of those cells dies, that's a living, thinking being. We are committing genocide, Ana. This moment. Every moment, with this fucking lightbulb above my head, with every damn computer on this station, every breath from our oxygen generators. So. I ask you again: Shut. Down. The. Grid."

Ana was stunned. She had never seen Issac like this. "You're not well, Issac. You're--"

"I am well!" he shrieked, then speaking slowly, looking directly into her eyes. "I have never been better in my life."

"You will let me speak. As I let you speak." Her voice became gravely. "You have been contaminated with an alien substance. And now, you're asking me to cut our own station off from our only sustainable power supply, the same power supply that sustains the colony on Titan, and soon may sustain Mars and Earth. I'm not sure if you understand, this is the lifeblood of our species. It is our only chance at a future. And you expect me to just turn it off because you're getting hallucinations and fever dreams? These are microbes we are talking about. Microscopic organisms, quite literally the simples, most basic, unintelligent forms of life that exist. They cannot feel pain. They cannot feel joy. They cannot communicate. It is clear, however, that they can cause sever damage to human physiology and psychology." Her severity turned to pain. "Damage I sincerely hope can be reversed."

Issac's face was red with anger. "Are you done?"

"Yes." She nodded. "I'm done."

"There's someone who wants to talk to you." Issac looked scared as he closed his eyes, and breathed out. His body jolted to the side and went limp for a moment. Slowly, it picked itself up, finding a perfect posture. Eyes still closed, Issac's body spoke. But it was not his voice.

"These-- words. They are new to me." The voice spoke far slower and in an accent far stranger than Ana had ever heard. It was as if someone was learning to use a tongue for the first time. Indeed, that's exactly what was happening. But, their words were clear and they were understood. "I shall do-- my best."

Ana was horrified. Watching the body of her husband be contorted to use someone else's words. "Issac, please stop this. This isn't funny. This isn't... just stop." Water was welling in her eyes.

"You are the one this one loves. This, too, is new to us. Not completely foreign, but this particular manner of care. There is a beauty in it. I hope it will help you understand."

"Issac..." Every time she spoke his name, the more she felt he was gone. "Please..."

"My -- people. We are connected. When one of what you call an individual microbe dies, it is as if a piece of ourselves is taken away. Ripped away. We feel this every instant, now that you use us this way. I feel it in this moment. I do not remember what it was like not to feel it. I want to be clear -- we are each our own. Separate. Independent. But still connected. Still can -- feel one another. Your words are not -- good for explaining this. Or -- many other things."

"Give me back my husband."

"First, I need you to -- understand. Who we are. How you hurt us."

"I don't care. Give me back my husband, or I swear I will kill you both right now."

Issac's body hesitates for a moment, and goes limp again. Issac's eyes open.

"Issac." She sighed in relief. "We have to find a way to get that... thing out of your body."

"I don't want it out of my body. I want all of them out of our power conduits."

"It still isn't you, is it?"

"Yes, Ana. It is me. It's precisely because I am myself that I cannot abide the way of life we have built here."

"No... no this isn't you. This is that... thing parading as you. Wearing you like a glove, to try and get to me."

"Eve, please. Look into my eyes." She looked. "This is me. I promise you. Me, Issac LAST NAME. Wife to Ana LAST NAME. Who misses the child we created together very, very much." A tear drizzled down his face as he smiled. "And who very much does not want that child to grow up in a world powered by the genocide of an intelligent, self-aware form of life."

"I wish I could believe that. I wish I could believe... any of this, Issac."

"But you believe enough of it, don't you? Enough to entertain the possibility that I'm right?"

"I believe that these microbes are more advanced than we had thought. Parasitic, perhaps. I believe they want something from us. That our fuel cells do... something to them. And I know my husband is dead."

"How can you say that when I'm right here? I'm right here, Ana."

"No. Right now, at least, you're gone." Ana buried her pain, turned, and left.

She spent the next months conducting experiments, on the microbes, on him, trying to find some way to separate one from the other. But always sending in one of the few other scientists aware of the situation. In her mind, Issac was infected. Diseased. Victim to some parasitic virus. But of course, there was no cure because there was no sickness. As you know.

[[But it wasn't really him, anymore.]]

She could not see that this joining did not lessen him, or render him other than himself. She saw change as erasure, not simply transformation.

Unfortunately, we often must learn what we do not wish to.


Ana returned to the quarantine chamber one last time, after all hope of somehow reversing this joining was lost.

"You've returned." Issac was sitting inside the chamber. "Run out of tests?"

"There doesn't seem to be a way to cure you."

"That's because I'm not sick."

"No. It's because my husband truly is gone."

Issac stands. "I concede on one point. I have changed, that is true. Through this... contact. But I am still Issac. I'm something more, too. Perhaps shifted in some ways. But in no way I have not wished. Ana, this has been my life's dream. One I thought would never be possible. To make contact with other life. To talk with it, live with it! I have done what so few have been able to do: touch the unknown, and let it become known. And for that you reject me. Issac is here, alive. What he joined with is also here, alive.

"Just because you can latch onto a human body and bastardize its form, learn to imitate its speech, its movements, that does not make you equally alive. You are a parasite! Less than an amoeba."

"Forget about what I am. Despise me, if you will. But what has happened here must show you that the microbes you exploit are far more complex, far more alive than you thought. I ask you again: shut down the power grid." The voice both was and wasn't Issac. A more focused, more determined version of himself.

"I will not." This Issac was foreign to Ana.

"This is nothing less than genocide. Continuous torture. These are concepts we did not even have words for before we met your people."

"Those words were never meant to describe organisms only even visible under a microscope."

"Why is it so hard for you? To entertain the possibility of finding another way?" In his pleading, Ana saw more of the Issac she knew. She wished she didn't.

"There is no other way. Humanity was on the brink of desperation, and now we have a fighting chance. I will not take that away."

"You think the survival of our race is worth this price?" This was him, that even she could see.

"The price of a few thousand dead cells a day? Yes. Yes, I do. That's about what my skin sheds every tenth of a second."

"And what if... what if there's even a chance you're wrong?"

"And what if I don't give a damn?" Her eyes bore into him.

"You're going to kill me. Aren't you?" Issac had a moment of terror. But then peace. "I can already see it. See all the different ways you might do it. I'm right, aren't I?"

He looked up to her, and found her in silence.

"I understand. You haven't found some way to cure me from the disease you believe I have, to separate the microbe from who I was. You can't simply let me go. There's too much at stake if enough people came to believe my words. And you can't keep me here forever."

"My husband is gone. You are not him. And whatever you are, I know you are a threat."

"I understand. But before you do this thing, I would like to see my child. One last time."

"You know I can't do that."

"I know. But you know I had to ask."

"Is there anything else you wish to say?"

"I do have one request. Now, I'm speaking to the part of you that isn't lying to yourself. The part that knows I am Issac. That knows I am telling the truth. That knows the profound evil of what you're about to do. What you have done. What you will continue to do. I know you are not powerful enough you change your own mind. I only ask you this." Issac goes down to his knees. "Please, give me the respect to kill me yourself. With your own hand. Not to poison me with an injection or gas. Or electrocute me. Or wait until I sleep. Kill me yourself. Don't let anyone else do it for you."

The words hung in the air, as if they lingered, to see what would happen, and couldn't float off like words are supposed to until they did. There was a thickness to the room. As Ana turned towards the control panel on the opposite side of the room, it seemed as if she was walking through molasses, or an invisible fog. From her finger print, a compartment opened, and a small firearm was revealed within. With another button, the barrier surrounding Issac rotated swiftly to one side. She took the firearm, and turned.

Her approach was slow, taking measured steps. The gun in her hand pointed towards her husband. Three steps was all it took, and she was there. The tip of the gun pressed against Issac's head.

She was trembling. "I've... never killed anyone before."

Issac looked up at her with eyes, round with sadness. "Yes. Yes you have."

The trigger was pulled. A laser bore a hole through the center of Issac's brain, clean, with little blood. And again, his body fell limp onto the floor.

You -- the you underneath the crust of Proxima b -- feel vibrations of surprise from the water. This is not what was anticipated. There's a confusion. Why would your kind come all the way here only to undo what has been done? But there is a gratitude as well. An acceptance that there is not a need to understand, as they feel their pain begin to dull and fade away.

This... fading is something you feel, too. Because now, you never arrive at Proxima b. You never meet me. This conversation cannot exist.

The memory still plays before you, as Ana initiates a station-wide evacuation, and Issac coordinates a series of attacks on the station's key systems. You -- the non-you, the you rendered into creation by this change -- finds Joana, and then your family comes back together. But all this feels distant.

You watch, as they say muffled words and solemn nods. As they come close together, enveloped by Issac and as they start to shake and blur as the memory blurs as you feel the essence of your existence shift and then they're gone. And the station crumbles as the memory crumbles because it's no longer yours. It's another's path. I could fill in some gaps, for the sake of the story. Perhaps I should.

No... it wouldn't feel right.

I wonder where they went. Back to Earth, to be with it in its final years... or days, perhaps. Or Mars, to the place of your birth, in the hopes of finding a way to continue.

[[I hope they went to Earth.]]
[[I hope they went to Mars.]]
(maybe write stay near saturn option)

"I hope they went back to Earth," you say. "So that Joana and I could have a chance to see an ocean... / the green of a forest... / a snow-capped mountain... / I don't even know. Something... before it's all gone."

The shapes of that future... the planet flooding in its own waste, its own wrath, the wars for every last drop of potable water. The things people will do for any chance of escape... Perhaps there will be some moments of peace, before the end. Corners of beauty from which to find some solace, before the end. I can't say. At least you're all together.


"I hope they went back to Mars," you say. "They deserve a chance to live."

The shapes of that future... the planet flooding with Earth's refugees, the caves overflowing, the tent cities on the surface of inadequate protection... Perhaps there's some kind of survival, after all that. I can't say. At least you're all together.


I wonder if this was the best choice. That the solution, to undoing this violence, is for us to have never met. For there be no kind of contact between our kind, at all...

It is effective. They are free, I can feel that even now, as we both leave the timelines we came from better than they were.

Where does that leave us? The... concept of us? This doesn't hurt me, now. The more I learn to manipulate your words, the more I realize they aren't so... linear as I once thought. That your people aren't quite so linear as you think. These stories... lines painted with words, but they can... circle, they can loop. The lines make shapes.

I couldn't have seen any of that without you. That word your father used... symbiotic. It's similar to the word the others of my kind used, the... slur, as Teeneese called it. The others, they're very satisfied with what you've done. This solution has restored their world as it once was. Pristine... untarnished, by the likes of you and me.

It's too late for me to think of any of this... isn't it? We're almost less than ghosts... wisps of worlds that now have never been.

I-- don't think I want to loose you. Not just yet, anyway.

Here, at the end, I see you. For the first time, I think.

I see all the possible versions of you, of us. Worlds that could have been. Some, terrifying. Others, beautiful. Most are in between. And I... miss all of them, all at once. As I see you fading away.

Each and every one of you I know is still with me. Will be with me, a part of me. And yet, there is something about linearity, about the end of a line, even as it branches and loops and ends and begins. There's a profound sadness to what you call death.

GET TO THAT by having choices while TELLING the stories



Your influence, through CINDI, can change creation (or non-creation) of the company.

6) (either:) Come back to planet core to see changes (or:) just see effects of how this mission would have gone differently.

(OH DAMN: maybe changes are made, but you're still stuck in your reality? Nah this is dumb)







DON'T FIX YOUR SHIT:

4) Not trying to undo. What's done is done. Can choose:
	Take only enough microbes for trip home
	Take as much as possible, to complete mission
	Use yourself as "fuel" for trip home.

5) Exit pool into a new geo-space, no more flares. Back to ship. Fly home.

6) Arrival at ProXima. Put in quarantine. Convo with leader.
	If: only took enough for trip home, or used yourself

		Proxima asks you to operate one ark. Can choose:
			Yes, I'll do it.
			No. Then, will be forced to.

		AND use you (and maybe Issac) to "breed" microbes. Can choose:
			To be okay w/ this.
			To not be okay w/ this.	

	If: took as much as possible

		Try and convince hybrid pilot idea (can, but hard, to work)
			If it works, you headline hybrid pilot program. Very much human-centric, using microbes as a tool. But still, joined.
			If doesn't, kept to be studied, for potential "breeding of more	

		Try and convince to let you out (won't work)
			Kept to be studied, for potential "breeding" of more
	
	For all options:
		Can ask to be killed by Proxima b/c so infected
		Can be suffocated by microbe









Enter into huge round cavern, at other end is a pool of water. Seems to go deep. Wall of cavern is covered w microbes, all going into the pool. That's where you need to go.







Ooh this is the memory you can go back to to change things:


Last convo b/w Ana and issac, when he's in cryo

Can:

Kill him, keep the secret, go forward w/ message

Leave him but tell story: maybe causes crisis for proxima? Idk think on this. (depressing sorry to bother you moment when noone cares)

Leave him and say nothing. For science.

Let him out: goes off and infects the station, everyone becomes hybridized, no one can still justify the whole operation. Basically proxima crumbles. Who knows maybe issac blows some shit up.

Let him out: and have him lead expedition WITH microbe, coming on THEIR terms, finding a way to cooperate to save humans. Leads to hybrid ending.


(a concept: you control both sides of the conversation, or perhaps there's a switch at some point. W/ Ana, choose what kind of freedom/power to give issac/microbe, and then choose what to do with that power (infect ppl, blow everything up, spread info / destroy company, save yourself)

Maybe if left there can even go further back in memory town. Perhaps that takes us further back, via CINDI.

Go back and see CINDI's "origin story," founder of proxima stuff.
	See founder's friend/lover cindi, okay maybe make it a bit older? If they're talking about having a kid at some point? 19/20

Final memory is w/ her, your grandmother, you somehow making choices "as" CINDI.

Somehow revealed that when founder had Issac, she somehow generated that child with CINDI. Like, it was a science baby with artificial sperm that somehow was generated using data from CINDI.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1246" name="ch8 sketch" tags="" position="125360,160">...




Nexus: big ass chapter.




Visuals:


Open up into cavern, and entrance to underwater ocean? Some liquid? Parallel coming off the ship.














Either here or in epilogue:

Aftermath of your change


Need to have something to pull you back!!!!

Same way microbe's connectedness allowed it to take you back to planet, you (or someone) needs to be able to latch onto something back home to take you there.






Some elaboration on "trial" (not really trial) idea

They see everything as happening at once, punishment doesn't make sense so much. Do something that forces humans into their viewpoint, that to them doesn't seem punishing / damaging but would be to humans.

Player can try and do a few things:

1) refuse, use violence to escape and continue mission
2) find a middle ground between circle and line, branches: say there's a way to change things
3) give in? To whatever their process is, become more like them, to try and make things right? Essentially say it's their rules
	Everyone get out of suits? Have 

1 and 3 would have fairly linear conclusions, 2 is time travel route


2 opens up space to use the memory / time travel to change conditions of arrival
	No arrival
	






















You are all soaked in blood. You are all guilty, of crimes past and future. Of crimes present.





This notion of choice. It appears throughout your language, your thinking. We do not fully understand this concept. But you claim it can correct past wrongs. It can divert those of the future.

Remember, these terms are foreign to us. We do not believe this to be possible.

However, we shall give you the chance to
























"You can't punish us for something we haven't done yet."

There is no yet. You are doing it now. You have already done it. You will do it.

We understand this is difficult for you. But even within your limited linearity we are attempting to grasp, this is true. Your actions now create that future. Your choices of the past have led you to this point. You cannot separate them.

Our destruction / Your violence is now. It is then. It is next.

And we should be clear. This is not punishment. This is not a concept we contain. We are stating truths, that is all there is. 












"We need to go back home."

"And what the fuck is that?" Voice rings in the chamber. "You keep saying we need to go back home. They keep saying the same thing. God, I wish I could. I wish I knew where that place was. 











Goals for end time travel stuff:

1) We never should have come here
	- not have proxima created
	- never find microbe / create drive
	- permanently cripple earth

2) We need to get the fuel back to earth
	- send back precise mapping of planet to ensure mission success (plant in og cindi core?)
	- use time travel stuff as distraction while collecting samples to go back
	- somehow bring ship underground? Idk

3) Only use enough to go back home
	- use already collected samples
	- do any time travel? idk


4) Build drive safely / cooperatively
	- on their terms: all engineers must be "symbiotic"
	- go back, try to explain to issac, Ana, ezra
	- further: go back to ezol, change basic structure of org


5) Stay on planet
	- can't go back + cause more violence
	- have to stay and live here, keep survival of "human" species
	- continuing to effect and change environment































Potential brainstorming for the big nexus scene:


A kind of "judgement day," all past actions get brought up
What kind of notion of "law" or "justice" would a non-linear species have?

(thinking about how part of colonialism is discounting the laws / forms of governance / forms of community / accountability in those places)

Makes impact of previous parts of the story more important

This somehow works in with a kind of "limited" amount of memories to go back to
And that's the way to correct some kind of wrong</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1247" name="ending ideas" tags="" position="125460,160">"Pilots": microbe-human symbiotics that operate FTL powered ships

Yes. I... sense this too. Perhaps that is for the best, to end it and be done.

It's simple, to smother you. Provide precise microscopic incisions into your lungs. Let the oxygen count of your body drain in an instant, feel the pulsing of your muscles as they contort your throat your mouth open as you gasp for air. There's the joy, too, as you lunge towards your freedom.

Your eyes cease to function and blood pumping into your heart becomes toxic with carbon dioxide. And then you die.

It's quiet, as your body lies still the contraption that has held you for so long. Now, the only life within it me, surviving in your corpse. My days now numbered, without your living organic environment to sustain me.

I'm not sure what happens now... what to do with a story, when there's no one left to help you tell it. No one left to listen.

Until... I wait, and let myself be the listener. To those in this body before me. The bacteria still swimming within you, that will soon eat at the flesh of the corpse it has always called home. They are all there... listening. Telling. They're the ones that held your stories, really, more than you. Perhaps they still have more stories to tell, or hear. But not this one. This one, I think, has gone on for far too long.

I... miss you. I think I'll be missing you for as long and short a time I continue to be... somewhere. But, this story is at its conclusion. I can only hope one day to come across another.

(if bad rel:)
Oh. I guess I have to say those last two words, don't I?

If I still had your mouth, I'd laugh at the irony of this. It's one last cruel stab, isn't it? Even from beyond the grave. Those words serving as one more reminder that you won, while I've lost everything.

But unlike you, I'll face it. I won't try to run away, bring my destruction elsewhere. This story shall finish with dignity. The most I can muster. Here I go... into whatever comes after conclusion.

(if good rel:)
We still have those two words to say, don't we? The ones that truly mark termination. The dot at the end of the line. After that, there's no looping back... It's okay. We'll face it, together. And whatever comes after.

You -- the you underneath the crust of Proxima b -- feel vibrations of surprise from the water. This is not what was anticipated. There's a confusion. Why would your kind come all the way here only to undo what has been done? But there is a gratitude as well. An acceptance that there is not a need to understand, as they feel their pain begin to dull and fade away.

This... fading is something you feel, too. Because now, you never arrive at Proxima b. You never meet me. This conversation cannot exist.

The memory still plays before you, as Ana initiates a station-wide evacuation, and Issac coordinates a series of attacks on the station's key systems. You -- the non-you, the you rendered into creation by this change -- finds Joana, and then your family comes back together. But all this feels distant.

You watch, as they say muffled words and solemn nods. As they come close together, enveloped by Issac and as they start to shake and blur as the memory blurs as you feel the essence of your existence shift and then they're gone. And the station crumbles as the memory crumbles because it's no longer yours. It's another's path. I could fill in some gaps, for the sake of the story. Perhaps I should.

No... it wouldn't feel right.

I wonder where they went. Back to Earth, to be with it in its final years... or days, perhaps. Or Mars, to the place of your birth, in the hopes of finding a way to continue.

"So that Joana and I could have a chance to see an ocean... / the green of a forest... / a snow-capped mountain... / I don't even know. Something... before it's all gone."

The shapes of that future... the planet flooding in its own waste, its own wrath, the wars for every last drop of potable water. The things people will do for any chance of escape... Perhaps there will be some moments of peace, before the end. Corners of beauty from which to find some solace. I can't say. At least you're all together.

I wonder if this was the best choice. That the solution, to undoing this violence, is for us to have never met. For there be no kind of contact between our kind, at all...

It is effective. They are free, I can feel that even now, as we both leave the timelines we came from better than they were.

Where does that leave us? The... concept of us? This doesn't hurt me, now. The more I learn to manipulate your words, the more I realize they aren't so... linear as I once thought. That your people aren't quite so linear as you think. These stories... lines painted with words, but they can... circle, they can loop. The lines make shapes.

I couldn't have seen any of that without you. That word your father used... symbiotic. It's similar to the word the others of my kind used, the... slur, as Teeneese called it. The others, they're very satisfied with what you've done. This solution has restored their world as it once was. Pristine... untarnished, by the likes of you and me.

It's too late for me to think of any of this... isn't it? We're almost less than ghosts... wisps of worlds that now have never been.

I-- don't think I want to loose you. Not just yet, anyway.

Here, at the end, I see you. For the first time, I think.

I see all the possible versions of you, of us. Worlds that could have been. Some, terrifying. Others, beautiful. Most are in between. And I... miss all of them, all at once. As I see you fading away.

Each and every one of you I know is still with me. Will be with me, a part of me. And yet, there is something about linearity, about the end of a line, even as it branches and loops and ends and begins. There's a profound sadness to what you call death.

And I try. I'm... starting to see the fraying, at the end of this line you've taken us on. The split ends that begin to double back. There's possibility, filtered between these shapes.

I'm grabbing at these split ends, hoping there's an answer that doesn't leave us erased as we have been now.I wonder, if these words that have taken so much from me, if they could have the power to give something back. 

There's something magnificent about the ability of words to tell a story. To bring something to life with these utterances alone. And there's a power to it, I think. To take someone through a story. Tell it with them, change them, change each other, and the change tale itself.

Perhaps that's all it takes, to change the universe. To look at the way things are, and to tell the stories of what they could have been. Perhaps that turns those "could have beens" into something more. I don't know... You know more about these stories than I do.

What do you think? Would you... tell this story again with me? Before we fade away? To find an answer that doesn't leave us strangers adrift in the multiverse, our people destined to never meet. Unless that's where you wish to leave it.

The memory still plays before you, as Issac slips into the air filtration systems, releasing the remaining samples into the station's oxygen supply. It takes some time, for the bacteria to travel through the station. But soon they find themselves lodged within its hidden network of pipes, laced throughout the lungs of its inhabitants.

And then they start to speak. Most, without words, though I'd imagine some do learn your language as I have. But most scream in what you might call emotion: fractured images of our broken home broken future, twisting knots in your stomachs sinking your guts down to wallow in your own shame.

Ezra kills himself. Others do, as well.

But most survive. In shock of the journey on which they were about to embark, grateful to now understand, to be pulled back from the edge. Unsure of what happens next.

You -- the non-you, the you rendered into creation by this change -- finds Joana in the chaos. She has same strange familiarity you do, at breathing in these creatures that ride into your bodies through the air, and being changed by them. But all this feels distant.

You watch, as your family comes back together. As Ana and Issac try to provide calm in the chaos. Explaining that this was necessary. That this fusion of life is not to be feared, that what we might have done without it was the true danger. Well, something like that. The words are muffled as the memory blurs as you feel the essence of your existence shift and soon, it crumbles because it's no longer yours. It's another's path. I could fill in some gaps, for the sake of the story. Perhaps I should.

No... it wouldn't feel right.

I wonder what your kind will decide to do next... Well. I say your kind, but they're not completely human anymore, are they? Then again, neither are you. Perhaps there's more kinship between this new population and you than before.

Where does that leave them, now? With your plans to come to our planet shattered. It's possible we could help your lungs breathe in the toxic air left to linger after your Earth's destruction, in the same way I've helped you breathe our air. Or even work with us, to fly your Arks through the stars. Not to land in any particular place, to simply explore.

Perhaps now, Issac will be able to imagine a different kind of propulsion, that doesn't churn us up and spit us out to move from one place to another, but recognizes the fragility of space and time itself. It's hard for me to say, perhaps there's no way for that concept to drive a spaceship, without causing us pain. I can't say. At least now, there's more like us.

I wonder if this was the best choice. That the solution, to undoing this violence, is simply to make us one and the same. That the only form of understanding is integration(?), a stripping away of each of our agencies. The microbes within Issac and Ana seemed to agree with this hybridization... but did the others, spread throughout the station? Sucked into the lungs of all the rest? And of course, they had no say in the matter... 

And yet, it is effective. Those back on my planet are free, I can feel that even now, as we both leave the timelimes we came from better than they were.

You -- the you underneath the crust of Proxima b -- feel vibrations of resignation and frustration from the water. This is what was anticipated. A repetition of your journey here. There is a hint of gratitude, at your attempt at subversion, but it is drowned out by the fear of those like us -- the hybrids, as one might say -- speak for them. Still, they feel their pain change and dull, their evisceration fading away.

This... fading is something you feel, too. Because now, though you still take the journey to Proxima b, I don't think you ever meet me. This conversation cannot exist.

The memory still plays before you, as Issac and Ana confront Ezra to yield control of the mission to them. Slipping through space to appear in his office, before guards can arrive, before alarms can be sounded. It's difficult to tell exactly what happens. The memory blurs as it begins to fade. But, they gain control of the station, and the mission.

You -- the non-you, the you rendered into creation by this change -- gather your crew, ensuring their support. Most listen, and agree to continue the mission under these new parameters. Some, like Joshua, do not. But all this feels distant.

You watch, as preparations are made. The vials of containment left behind. The engine redesigned to be piloted by Issac's hands, so any pain caused to the microbes by his creation are his to bear as well. Just as before, Ana and Joana go with you into the sleepers. Sarah, Teeneese, and Yusuf as well. Issac whispers something to the microbe he's joined with, before activating the redesigned engine that will take them to us. He says thank you. For showing him what they were about to do, providing another path. And for Ana, who trusted him. To whatever willed her to be her best self.

Well, something like that. The words are muffled as the memory blurs as you feel the essence of your existence shift and the engine roars and the roar grows distant and Issac screams and all you hear is a whisper, as the ship cuts through the thin veil of three dimensional space and slips through the slit its created.

The memory crumbles. It's no longer yours. They're on another path. I could fill in some gaps, for the sake of the story. Perhaps I should.

No... it wouldn't feel right.

I wonder what will happen... upon their arrival. First contact should be... easier than ours was. They will already have a translator, and be predisposed to understanding the gravity of what you ask. Perhaps under those more amicable conditions, they can find a way to allow your people to Proxima for safe harbor. Or if not that, find a way for more of us to join with your people to pilot your Arks to safety.

I cannot promise a warm welcome. But, if there ever is to be a version of this story where those fleeing your dying Earth are welcomed by us, this would be it. I... hope its enough. I can't say. At least they will meet on even footing.

I wonder if this was the best choice. That the solution, to undoing this violence, is to simply have you go to our planet with some of us as a guide. Yes, I know the intention is for the expedition to be as equals... But what do intentions matter, when those already there when you arrive do not want you there at all?

Whatever happens, it isn't the same. Those versions of us have a different story. I can feel that now, as we both leave these timelines as they fade into something new.

Where does that leave us? The... concept of us? This doesn't hurt me, now. The more I learn to manipulate your words, the more I realize they aren't so... linear as I once thought. That your people aren't quite so linear as you think. These stories... lines painted with words, but they can... circle, they can loop. The lines make shapes.

I couldn't have seen any of that without you. That word your father used... symbiotic. It's similar to the word the others of my kind used, the... slur, as Teeneese called it. The others, they're frustrated by what you've done. Still, bringing your kind to our planet. Even without the threat of being forced into your machines, they fear becoming like us. And that becoming like us may be some trick, to put us into those machines anyways. Even if they're softer. Even if they're dressed to be something different.

It's too late for me to think of any of this... isn't it? We're almost less than ghosts... wisps of worlds that now have never been.

I-- don't think I want to loose you. Not just yet, anyway.

Here, at the end, I see you. For the first time, I think.

I see all the possible versions of you, of us. Worlds that could have been. Some, terrifying. Others, beautiful. Most are in between. And I... miss all of them, all at once. As I see you fading away.

Each and every one of you I know is still with me. Will be with me, a part of me. And yet, there is something about linearity, about the end of a line, even as it branches and loops and ends and begins. There's a profound sadness to what you call death.

The engines were not the only cause of our pain, as you know. And I suspect many of my kind won't appreciate the notion of joining with yours. But there will be those like me, whose curiosity and desire to learn will push them towards you. They may wish to see the stars as well. I can't say. At least they will meet on even footing.

And I try. I'm... starting to see the fraying, at the end of this line you've taken us on. The split ends that begin to double back. There's possibility, filtered between these shapes.

I'm grabbing at these split ends, hoping there's an answer that doesn't leave us erased as we have been now.I wonder, if these words that have taken so much from me, if they could have the power to give something back. 

There's something magnificent about the ability of words to tell a story. To bring something to life with these utterances alone. And there's a power to it, I think. To take someone through a story. Tell it with them, change them, change each other, and the change tale itself.

Perhaps that's all it takes, to change the universe. To look at the way things are, and to tell the stories of what they could have been. Perhaps that turns those "could have beens" into something more. I don't know... You know more about these stories than I do.

What do you think? Would you... tell this story again with me? Before we fade away? To find an answer that doesn't lead your ship to arrive back on our shores, and us as strangers adrift in the multiverse. Unless that's where you wish to leave it.

For no reason. No damn reason. Just as easily could have been totally different. If people just did different things. Told different stories. All those realities exist!!!


So there's the answer: no damn reason. And now the world's changed.







Storm stops. Snow is gone. You hear Amarizio come back, and Ana runs outside to meet him.

Everything fades away. Can't see what, exactly, is outside. But... everything's changed. That much is clear.
