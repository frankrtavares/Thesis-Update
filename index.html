Note to readers:
Hi! Thank you so much for reading over a draft of my thesis, it&#39;s really appreciated. :) Beyond letting me know about any technical issues (broken/misdirected links, plot holes, etc), I&#39;m also looking for feedback on what characters / character moments, themes, and plot threads are/aren&#39;t resonating. (And feedback on the basic level of whether it was enjoyable, easy to read, etc as well!) 

My current estimate for readtime is about 3-4 hours. If you could keep track of about how long it takes to read the story and let me know, that will help me see if that&#39;s an over or under estimate.

There&#39;s a save/load function if you don&#39;t want to read it in one sitting in the side bar, and a form to give feedback and general comments at any time.

If you&#39;re coming back to the story (and if the &#39;load&#39; option isn&#39;t working), you can also use the sidebar chapter links or &quot;Chapter Select&quot; to go back to where you were. That may mess up tracking your previous choices, but should be possible. Here&#39;s a spot to put your name in again if you need to: &lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$name&quot; &quot;Type your protagonist&#39;s name here.&quot;&gt;&gt;

[[Epilogue]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Prologue" tags="pro" position="3911,560" size="100,100">I want to believe I&#39;m not lying to you, when I say there can be a better way.

That I&#39;m not just naive.

I want to believe there&#39;s something good in that swell the stars tease out of every curious pair of young eyes. That it&#39;s not all just hunger. A desire to gnaw away at the unknown. That it&#39;s more than a desire to own and touch them for the sake of touching.

There must be a way for understanding to be enough. For learning to not predecess an owning of knowledge.

I&#39;m probably wrong. Because we&#39;ve told this story before... and here we are, about to tell it again.

The story of when you came to touch the stars. And found me. The story of when you [[arrive.-&gt;arrive start]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="arrive start" tags="pro" position="4123,561" size="100,100">(The story begins with a circle on the screen. It&#39;s perfectly round, against a while background. There&#39;s nothing else. At any click, the Circle begins to compress, (ideally starting at point closest to the click, but that probably won&#39;t happen). It starts to flatten out and bends into an oval. The oval flattens and flattens until it simply becomes a line. Text fades in above the shape.)


There is a beauty in a line. In a beginning, and in an end. In how a line can bend to create a circle in how a circle can bend to create a line.

How easily they can be broken. How hard it is to put the pieces back together.

All shapes are the same. Just twisted, in different ways. Changed to fit the hand that molds them.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

(click the line that was the circle again and the text below begins to appear)

Let us start with these smaller shapes: these words. Curved into meaning, shapes evoking voice. 

The first, your name: &lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$name&quot; &quot;Type your protagonist&#39;s name here.&quot; autofocus&gt;&gt;

Once you have left your marks, we may [[continue.-&gt;Write Name]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Write Name" tags="pro" position="4345,552" size="100,100">Thank you, $name. Now, we can start to see what shape you will take. Which of these strange shapes you&#39;ll choose as your own. But for now... there&#39;s only possibility.

I wish we could stay on this page forever. You and me, just... sitting in the blank space before and after everything begins to turn.

There aren&#39;t many things I love about these words that have taken so much from me. But the canvas of a first page will never cease to give me hope. The elegance of a story, the perverse pleasure of controlling it and telling it: those gifts I treasure. Those gifts I thank you for.

From here, I can see all of you. Each inflection, split, alternative. Those I loathe and those I love. See all the versions of us that are happy those that were driven to kill each other and those that didn&#39;t care. Those are the worst, I think.

And as soon as I continue, they splinter. Narrow and expand. I keep... chasing the paths where we find our ways into harmony. But there&#39;s always a branch that snags me, pulls me off. I never can get the right one. I can never see past the thorns.

I&#39;ve started trying to get used to their pricks. But that&#39;s no good. Instead, I have to believe, this time will be different. There&#39;s always that possibility.

From here, there&#39;s only the arrival.

This is the beginning. This is the end. These are both lies. These are both truths.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;[[&#39;--&#39;-&gt;Chapter 1]]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Chapter 1" tags="ch1" position="2224,472" size="100,100">&lt;center&gt;I.&lt;/center&gt;

Everything begins in the dark. The smell of oxidized gas is the first to fill your nostrils. The jolts of nausea cause your body to quiver as you come out of unconsciousness. The first voice you hear is sharp, metallic, pointed. Somehow soft. &quot;You have arrived. Wake up. You have arrived.&quot;

Eyes blink open. You are inside a container, two straps crossing your body, holding you down. The upper half is glass, frosted over. You feel spikes crawl up your fingers and toes as warmth ripples through them. &quot;Wake up. You have arrived. Wake up.&quot; Your skin is cold.

&quot;My memory is a void.&quot; Yusuf&#39;s voice is low. Teenesee looks down.

Joana is turned away. Most give you back blank and confused stares. Sarah turns and looks around the room. You notice her left fist is clenched, her knuckles white, while her chest moves rhythmically up and down. &quot;Joshua and Teenesee, go see if you can find anything from that panel. Yusuf and... the one who was yelling. Take a closer look at these pods, see if there&#39;s any other information besides our names. The Captain and I will go look at the door, at the far end.&quot;

You turn to see everyone slowly moving towards their designated area of investigation. Sarah is on her way to the door, and you follow.

&quot;I wonder how you got to be Captain. We elect you? Assigned to us? Mutiny?&quot; She turns back. &quot;I guess we&#39;ll never know.&quot;

You both hear a voice from the other end of the ship. &quot;Hey!

And all we need to open them are our hands.&quot; She holds both of hers out. &quot;And some weird suits...&quot;

Joshua, Joana, and Yusuf stand straight, and hurridly make their way over.

&quot;Can&#39;t have forgotten our hands, right?&quot; Yusuf says on his way. You and Sarah join them.

There is a small corridor through the door. Lining both sides are a series of lockers, nine total, each with a name on them, and a hand-shaped indent. On the far side is a large closet, one door pulled slightly to the side. In the opening, you see the arm of a clean white suit hanging out. It looks like a life-sized plastic model.

&quot;Look,&quot; says Teenesee, her voice bringing you back to the lockers. As she puts her hand against the locker with her name, there&#39;s a small hiss as the air decompresses, and it swings toward her. &quot;I can open it.&quot;

You recognize it as a delta. There&#39;s large boxes attached to the back.

&quot;They must be hazard suits of some kind,&quot; says Sarah, whose locker is close. &quot;For whatever is beyond the door.&quot;

The locker is empty. You feel the inside, looking for a hidden compartment, something you may have missed. But there&#39;s nothing. Quietly, you close the locker.

&quot;See how it is.&quot; She closes her locker. Between her fingers, you see what looks like a postcard or Polaroid photo.

Looking down the hall, you see everyone looking through their belongings. Yusuf is holding some kind of digitally projected sphere, glitching on and off. Joshua pulls out what looks like sheets of paper, small dots and lines across it. Teenesee is inspecting something small in her hand, but you can&#39;t see what it is. Sarah is clipping something to her earlobes.

&quot;Empty? Fuck.&quot; She closes her locker and turns to you. &quot;This was in mine.&quot;

She hands you what looks like a Polaroid. There are four figures in the photo, two in the back, one in the front, another in someone&#39;s arms. On the right, you see a smaller, younger Joana staring back. Her hair longer, smile wider.

The two people in the back stood close. On the right, a tall lanky man, eyes blue and hair a dirty blond. Wry smile. In his arms, a child. Small enough to fit comfortably in the corner of his elbow and arm. On the left, a slightly shorter woman, brown eyes and tightly curled black hair. You notice her arm stretching behind the man&#39;s back, hand resting on his shoulder.

[[&quot;It could be fake.&quot;]]

&quot;Doesn&#39;t feel fake.&quot; Joana shakes her head. &quot;Feels like I had a family I loved and that loved me, and now all I&#39;ve got is an empty head.&quot;

The figures seem to be standing inside of some kind of glass dome. Through the glass, a dusty red and rocky landscape stretches out. Mountains stretch up in the distance, touching a sky at dusk, stars beginning to make their way out as a sun begins to hide behind the horizon&#39;s peaks.

&quot;What is that?&quot; you ask Yusuf as you float over towards him. The projection is coming from a small, round black device.

&quot;It&#39;s a compass.&quot; You see him clicking the device, trying to get it to work properly. &quot;It&#39;s broken, but clearly a three dimensional compass. Look, there&#39;s a line in the projected sphere. But each time it glitches, the direction changes.&quot;

Her earrings rise for a moment, staying afloat in the weak gravity. They&#39;re a pair of wood-carved turtles, and seem to be swimming as they drift down to rest.

&quot;Thank you for your designation number, Teenesee Jayplo.&quot; CINDI&#39;s voice had a hint of relief. &quot;Clearance Level 3 unlocked. You are ready to receive the Mission Briefing.&quot;

Teenesee exhaled and let her muscles loosen. You move back into the main room, and the others follow. She turns to you all.

&quot;Outside? We don&#39;t know--&quot; Yusuf is stressed. &quot;We know nothing about what&#39;s out there.&quot; 

&quot;Of course not. And we won&#39;t until we take a look.&quot; There&#39;s a shallow glow to Sarah&#39;s face. You&#39;re not sure if it&#39;s coming from the suppressed smile or how the blue light bounces off her eyes.

&quot;No. We have-- we have time.&quot; Yusuf&#39;s words grew slower. &quot;We stay in here, find some way to power the drives, and then... go back into cryo. Go home.&quot;

&quot;So the AI can kill us in our sleep when we run out of oxygen on the way home? No.&quot; Sarah glances at you. &quot;$name, you saw the hazard suits. Their design goal is clear: exploration of the unknown. And it&#39;s just on the other side of that door.&quot;

&quot;Our own minds are the great unknown.&quot; Yusuf pointed to his head. &quot;The mystery I want to solve is right here, not out there.&quot;

&quot;What are we doing here?&quot; Teenesee&#39;s eyes are glazed over. &quot;We don&#39;t even know what we&#39;re doing here.&quot;

&quot;Information on mission objectives is classified to Level 2,&quot; CINDI replies. Teenesee&#39;s eyes snap into focus, as if she didn&#39;t expect a reply.  She doesn&#39;t respond.

&quot;The nine of you are fulfilling the mission of this company since its inception: to bring humanity to the stars. Beyond the Sol system we call home.&quot; The smile falters. &quot;Most of you are scientists. All of you have the hearts of explorers. But I remind you: we are in a fight for the very survival of our race. I know your first instinct will be learn as much as you can. Don&#39;t get lost trying to understand this place. There will be time for that, later.

&quot;Your goal is simple: identify and retrieve strands of the bacteria //Proximus fomes//, whose origins we have traced here. This biological material is the fuel for the Exodus Drive that powers the //Prodromos//, that will power the Arks to evacuate Earth.

&quot;//Proximus fomes// was discovered under the ice of Saturn’s moon, Enceladus. Soon after, it was discovered this alien microbial life can create small bends in space-time. The Exodus Drive uses that to enable faster-than-light travel. It&#39;s easiest to describe via analogy. These &quot;bends&quot; can allow a ship to be spun fast enough that it can be &quot;skipped&quot; across space-time to its destination. Like a small rock on a pond.

&quot;Yours is the first ship to use this. The first, we hope, of many. But without those samples, these engines are worth nothing. Including the one on your ship now. The only way home is by finding that biofuel.

&quot;Determining the permanent habitability of the planet is a secondary objective. If you encounter intelligent life, avoid it at all costs. Refer to CINDI&#39;s &#39;First Contact&#39; protocol if necessary.

&quot;Those samples are essential. They take precedent over all else, including your own lives.&quot;

The man presses a button and images appear above his desk. A long cylinder, a small pill-shaped device, and what looks like a syringe.

The objects disappear. The man at the desk leans forward. &quot;I don&#39;t have to tell you how important it is that you accomplish this. That you come back. We have contingencies in place to ensure the best of humanity can survive until your return, whether that&#39;s on Earth or elsewhere in Sol. But I can imagine it&#39;ll be easy to get... caught up in the most profound discoveries of our civilization. I wish we had more time to let you relish in that.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t even know what to ask,&quot; you say. &quot;None of this makes sense.&quot;

&quot;Apparently the video did not make this clear,&quot; says CINDI. &quot;You are spearheading an evacuation. Earth, the planet of birth for the human species, is nearly dead. Its inhabitants, scattered throughout an inhospitable solar system. Many in cryogenic sleep, like the kind you were brought here in.

&quot;This bacteria you are collecting is the fuel for an engine that could make travel beyond the speed of light instantaneous. The trip here, which should have taken many lifetimes, reduced to hours. The cryogenic chambers are for your safety, not to pass the time as they were previously used.

&quot;For humanity to remain in Sol will end in death. Project Exodus is a solution to this problem. Upon your return with this fuel, a series of Arks shall be prepared to take humanity here. And elsewhere, if need be. To survive.&quot;

&quot;How does this Exodus Drive work?&quot; you ask. &quot;How can... bacteria power a ship?&quot;

&quot;This was the invention of your late father, before his untimely death prior to your voyage,&quot; says CINDI. &quot;The Exodus Drive he created is the most advanced piece of technology developed by humankind. Even he wouldn&#39;t be able to explain the source of the power, the microbes. Only that their properties allow space and time to fold, and thus be traversed at speeds impossible otherwise.&quot;

They slip on with comfort, the fresh padding lined inside squeaking against the lining of your thin jumpsuits. The material is snug against your body, not worn in yet. The helmet feels like a fish bowl. You, on the inside, and the world watching as your head swims about. The boots are heavy, sticking to any surface they make contact with. The stability feels comforting after so much floating.

Behind you, two metal doors emerge from the sides of the ship and meet in the middle, sealing all of you in a small chamber. There&#39;s a whoosh, as the oxygen in the compartment is removed. You feel your suits flooding your helmets with thin, fresh air. Lungs feel heavy. Panting rings in your ears. After a few moments, the large circular component of the door in front of you begins to turn.

There&#39;s little light, but something is reflecting back moments of blinding white. Even at the edge of the door, it&#39;s difficult to make out what&#39;s before you. There&#39;s a final clunk as the doors of the ship come to a close. The shimmering begins to grow slower. As your eyes adjust, you find the figures beginning to take shape. Becoming still. Rounded heads. Thick bodies. You count... six.

&quot;It&#39;s... water.&quot; You hear Joana&#39;s voice in your helmet, as if over radio. &quot;A wall of water.&quot;

The figures solidify. Six exosuits, staring back at you. The helmets reflect as gray surfaces, no faces to be seen underneath. For a moment, you wonder if your first visitors on this alien world are simply ghosts of yourselves. But someone has already reached out and touched the water&#39;s surface, sending a ripple shimmering across the ghosts until they disappear.

The empty suits stare back at all of you as you approach the wall of water. It&#39;s dark, but as you approach the edge of the ship, it&#39;s clear there&#39;s no ground between you and the reflective liquid.

&quot;There&#39;s some kind of chasm,&quot; you hear Yusuf say through your helmet.

&quot;It&#39;s not a chasm.&quot; It&#39;s Sarah, and you see she&#39;s already left the ship, standing on the surface of the liquid, perpendicular to the rest of you. &quot;We&#39;re just sideways. All you need to do is jump.&quot;

Leaning forward, you see the water stretches back and back, until it curves behind a horizon. She&#39;s right, all you need to do is [[jump to the surface.-&gt;jump to planet]]

You try and swing your legs to give direction to your movement, but end up knocking into the other side of the ship. Grabbing the edge of the now open door, you push yourself down towards the water, landing softly by Sarah.

The water is shallow. As the boots of your suit hit the surface, some liquid splashes into the air, droplets floating up. Under the liquid, your boots hit a hard floor. Ripples echo out, but soon the water returns to rest. Completely still. Again, you see the reflection of your helmet staring back from the water, empty. There are two splattered eggs of light lying on the oceans surface, far in front of you. As you lift your head, you see twin moons shining down, their light dancing on the waves. The water stretches out before you, in all directions, until the horizon is met and the water transitions into sky and stars. In the dark, you can&#39;t quite find that horizon, sky and sea melt together. Stars and reflections merge.

The quiet is what strikes you most. The hissing the ship, gone. There are quiet splashes as the others make their way down. As you turn, you notice the four mechanical legs holding the ship upright. You still stand directly under it, the legs around you. Almost everyone is on the ground, except Joshua, still on the ship.

There were still small waves rippling out from your feet, but when you let your body rest, the water would grow perfectly still. As if it was glass. Glass within which the stars were frozen.

&quot;Of course we landed in the ocean,&quot; says Joana.

&quot;It&#39;s good the water is this shallow,&quot; says Sarah. &quot;And on the bright side, a liquid environment is the perfect place to start collecting samples.&quot;

&quot;I agree,&quot; says CINDI. &quot;I will begin instructions on biosample collection. It will be easier with a volunteer to demonstrate. Joshua, perhaps?&quot;

He looks startled, but pleased. &quot;Uh, sure.&quot;

On your personal channel, CINDI says, &quot;I thought this may prove good for his morale.&quot;

She continues, speaking to the group. &quot;The collection process is designed for extreme efficiency and ease, capable of collecting materials from any anticipated environment, at any time. Joshua, do you mind carefully placing your hand on the surface of this liquid?&quot;

Slowly, he leans down, pressing his hand against the surface of the water. &quot;Like this?&quot;

&quot;Exemplary, thank you,&quot; she continues. &quot;To the side of your helmet&#39;s interface, you&#39;ll see a tracker, counting the biosamples you&#39;ve collected from the environment. When you activate your suit&#39;s collection mode, the pores of your suit will open up and intake biosamples.&quot;

Joshua has already gone ahead and activated the sample collection. There&#39;s a quiet sucking sound, and you notice the glove covering Joshua&#39;s hand is taking in very small amounts of water. Minuscule whirlpools are spinning just beneath his fingers.

&quot;You can see the suit&#39;s collection mechanism at work,&quot; says CINDI. &quot;The biosamples are taken in by collection pores integrated into your suit&#39;s gloves and boots, then transported to the storage cannisters in your packs. Go ahead, give it a try now.&quot;

Joshua lifts his hands, the whirlpools spinning for a moment before the water grows still again. He reaches back into his pack, and takes out one of the palm-sized cannisters.

Your boots buzz as similar whirlpools appear about your feet. There&#39;s a cool sensation as you feel the collected water coarsing through the veins of your suit&#39;s tubing towards your back, where the materials come to rest.

&quot;Excellent,&quot; says CINDI. &quot;Do not forget to continue and collect samples as you explore the environment. You can do so at any time.&quot;

Sarah raises her hand, cutting off the conversation. &quot;Quiet!&quot; She reaches to her suit&#39;s pack, and takes out a bright yellow glow stick. &quot;Everyone needs to stand perfectly still.&quot; Confused, the group plants their feet and begins to steady themselves.

&quot;Look at the water,&quot; she says. The ripples caused by your walk over are fading, the liquid growing close to still. For a moment, it is.

The whirlpools continue to open and close in pairs, moving around in front of all of you, causing the water to ripple, all your reflections disrupted by the movement.

&quot;They&#39;re steps,&quot; says Teenesee. &quot;Look... it&#39;s like something&#39;s walking. Like a ghost on the water.&quot;

Each step falls in a rhythm, close to the previous, taking the pair somewhere new.

&quot;Oh god...&quot; Joshua steps back, sending splashes in the water. The steps move back as well. But as Joshua steps back, he looses his balance, falling down head first, water splashing around him. Next to the whirlpools, water erupts a moment later.

Everyone hears it first. The hiss of oxygen escaping. Then gagging over the intercom.

&quot;The energy source of the suit could potentially be used as a defibrillator, though--&quot;

Soon, there&#39;s a rhythm. You manage to reach the others. The splashing as each person lifts their feet creates an orchestra of sound.

Switching the intercom to talk to the group, you say, &quot;We should set up camp for tonight. No point in exhausting ourselves.&quot;

Everyone begins to slow down and turn to you. &quot;Camp? How can we camp here?&quot; asks Yusuf.

&quot;Using the portable enclosure in micro-gravity, of course,&quot; says CINDI.

&quot;Oh, of course, how could I forget?&quot; Yusuf&#39;s reply gets a few chuckles.

The devices aren&#39;t difficult to set up. Each has a base that anchors itself to the surface, under the water. A cable connects the base to what looks like a cocoon of thick fabric, floating in the low gravity. Each one spreads open, showing loose straps inside.

&quot;We&#39;re supposed to... go inside that?&quot; asks Joana.

&quot;Yes, look! You just place yourself against the padding on this side, close the fabric. It looks like the padding has microgears, likely to press against your back and simulate a bed.&quot; Yusuf explains this all while looking at his device with glee. &quot;Whoever invented this was brilliant.&quot;

&quot;You invented it, Yusuf,&quot; says CINDI. &quot;And indeed, it was heralded as quite innovative.&quot;

&quot;Well. Now I just seem like a narcissist,&quot; he replies.

The makeshift habitats are spread haphazardly out amongst the water. Floating cocoons above the water and reflected down beneath it, inviting someone to inhabit them.

&quot;Before resting, I recommend consuming a daily nutritional supplement,&quot; says CINDI. &quot;They can be delivered from a tube directly within your suit.&quot;

A small straw moves up from the back of your helmet close to your lips. You suck on it, a cold and thick paste entering your body. It tastes good, and your body appreciates the sustenance.

Sarah awkwardly squats towards the floor, and then sits in the shallow water. &quot;Let&#39;s sit down for dinner,&quot; she says. &quot;The suits will keep us dry, don&#39;t worry.&quot;

The others join her, though Joana and Teenesee remain standing.

&quot;I merely provided a recommendation, not a command,&quot; says CINDI. &quot;You are the Captain, the decision is yours.&quot;

The group continues to walk on, until Joshua breaks the silence. &quot;CINDI, please tell me we&#39;ve got something in the back of these suits that&#39;ll let me get some sleep.&quot;

&quot;I am happy to report the portable enclosure in micro-gravity is a device to serve that need,&quot; replies CINDI. &quot;They may be deployed whenever the group stops for the evening.&quot;

&quot;As an increase of refugees from Earth began to overflow into the Martian colonies, Proxima began using cryogenic chambers to transport humans from Earth to Mars,&quot; says CINDI. &quot;Though the trip&#39;s short length of several months didn&#39;t require them, in the long-term the increased efficiency was more profitable.

&quot;Eventually, there were more colonists arriving than capacity on Mars. Many of these cryo chambers were put into storage, left unopened. The locals began to refer to them as the &#39;sleepers.&#39; Soon, the term became ubiquitous with the devices themselves.&quot;

The snow on Enceladus fell so slow the human eye couldn&#39;t perceive its downward spiral to the ground. Instead, the specks of fine powder appeared to float in the thin atmosphere. The tiny particles of ice came from the geysers jettisoning water from the moon&#39;s surface. Some of the ice particles were thrust into space, pulled into Saturn&#39;s gravitational pull and forming one of the planets rings. But some didn&#39;t make it that far, left to be lightly tugged towards the ground, giving the moon&#39;s surface of ice a light powdering.

Issac thought about the first time he stood here, underneath the glass dome of Cassini Station&#39;s observational deck. He knew before arriving that the low gravity gave snow &quot;fall&quot; an entirely different meaning. But he didn&#39;t know that stillness would make the world seem frozen in time, as if they were all living in molasses.

Tonight, the stars decorated the sky behind Saturn&#39;s rings. The floating snow made it seem as if the stars were slowly drifting closer to them.

&quot;Why did you bring me here again, dad?&quot; you asked. Issac looked back into your eyes, thinking about how this was the only world you knew, where stray objects would stick in the air and snow took millions of years to fall. He thought about when he was around six years old, and how his mother explained he was from a place called Earth, the same place Issac was born but too young to remember.

[[&quot;I want to show you where mom and I were born.&quot;]]
[[&quot;I want to show you where you came from.&quot;]]

You didn&#39;t seem to fully understand. &quot;You weren&#39;t born on Mars, like me?&quot;

&quot;I was born on Earth, a planet very far away.&quot; 

Close to the far edge of the dome was a long telescope on a round swivel. Issac had positioned it before bringing you here, making sure the eye piece was low enough for you to peer through.

&quot;Go on, take a look.&quot; Issac gently moved you towards the telescope and kneeled to your height. Hesitantly, you put your eye to the telescope.

&quot;What do you see?&quot; Issac asks.

&quot;There&#39;s just a dot. It&#39;s blueish.&quot; Your voice had a hint of wonder.

Issac smiled. &quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s Earth?&quot; You sounded surprised.

&quot;That&#39;s Earth,&quot; he nodded.

&quot;Why is it so blue?&quot; You took your eye away from the telescope to ask the question.

&quot;That&#39;s because of all the oceans.&quot;

You thought about this for a moment. &quot;Mom&#39;s mom lived by the ocean, right?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right, she did.&quot;

You go back to look again. &quot;It&#39;s so small.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s because it&#39;s so far away.&quot;

&quot;Why did we go so far?&quot;

[[&quot;Well... because we could.&quot;]]

&quot;That&#39;s a silly reason.&quot;

&quot;It is.&quot; Issac tried to find a way to explain. &quot;Sometimes we don&#39;t know why we do things, but we feel like we need to. Sometimes all we have are silly reasons. Does any of that make sense?&quot;

&quot;A little bit.&quot;

&quot;There were other reasons we left home, too. But that... indefinable urge to explore was the strongest, I think.&quot; You seemed to like that.

&quot;Dad, can I ask you a question?&quot;

&quot;Of course, you can always ask me anything.&quot; He took your hand.

&quot;Things like... what is life like on other planets? Where does that life come from? And where did we come from?&quot;

&quot;There were too many people and too little land. Too many storms and fires. So, we left home and went to Mars. And then we came here.&quot;

&quot;We... moved overnight, we hit the shore.&quot; There&#39;s a hesitancy to his voice. &quot;And... man, I don&#39;t know if you had the dreams we had but... just come on out.&quot;

Arms and legs slip out of the straps keeping you in place for the night, and you slip back into your suit. Once you twist your helmet back into place, you open up the flaps of your hab. Light shines through the opening, it takes a moment for your eyes to adjust. But you don&#39;t see the water. You see land.

The anchors you placed on the rock hard floor of a shallow ocean now sat on a sandy shore, small waves causing them to sway ever so slightly on the shifting sand. You push your way fully out of the hab. Behind you remains the water, no spaceship in sight, just a darkness on the horizon. Before you, the sand reaches out until it hits a rising sun that splatters golden and red light across everything. Or perhaps it was a sunset.

Yusuf and Sarah are already in their suits, walking along the shore to wake everyone up. Joana is standing on the shore, looking out into the desert.

Soft crunches of wet sand under boots begins to fall in random patterns. &quot;Where did you find that, Yusuf?&quot; asks Sarah.

&quot;Just a bit upshore, next to five other objects.&quot; He points to further up on the sandy bank. &quot;I think there&#39;s something for each of us.&quot;

You walk over, and find the assortment of objects. The other&#39;s follow. Poking out from under the sand, you see a long, rusted gold rod. It&#39;s a telescope.

&quot;He had a heart attack while we were in cryogenic sleep, on our way to Saturn.

&quot;I recommend every group checking in at least every hour for a status update,&quot; says CINDI. &quot;And I reiterate the Captain&#39;s words: good luck.&quot;

Sand is difficult to traverse in low gravity, as you soon found out. Every step sends the shallow dune formations into disarray, floating up over your boots and slowly down, pooling about your heels, until you lift the foot, making it all tumble into the created crevice and so on. The first hour, noticing this pattern is the most noteworthy occurance. The sun has slowly grown higher in the sky. Joana takes some samples of the sand, but other than that, the landscape is no more alien than usual.

&quot;This is Sarah, checking in after our first hour,&quot; she says over the suit intercom. &quot;I&#39;ve collected some wet soil samples from the shore, my mobile lab is processing now. I&#39;ll update with any noteworthy results, though they&#39;ll likely only come in by tomorrow.&quot;

Yusuf calls in next. &quot;Not much to report here, either. We&#39;ve been collecting soil samples as well. When we regroup, hopefully Joana can get a date on them. Other than that, it&#39;s still a beautiful sunrise on the coast.&quot;

You blink, and it&#39;s gone. Reappeared closer, to your right. You turn, putting distance between you and the figure. Your breathing grows heavier, your heart rate faster. Several menacing beeps emit from your suit.

&quot;I recommend slowing down your pace, especially in this heat,&quot; says CINDI. &quot;These suits were not designed for this kind of exertion in this environment.&quot;

You continue, your steps turning into small jumps, heightened from the low gravity. After one of these, your foot catches the sand as you fall back, pushing your body softly into the sand. You see the bottom half of the figure steps in front of you.

&quot;Captain, you are suffering from extreme rates of heat exhaustion,&quot; her voice is more urgent than its ever been. &quot;Please pace yourself. Make your way back to shore. Please pace yourself.&quot;

Each blink seems to last longer than the last as you drag and float yourself forward towards the figure&#39;s feet.

A soft fog is blown into the airlock. You shiver as it touches you, blanketing you in a numbness that you know will take over your entire body shortly. The gas prepared your body for the freezing liquid that would flood your sleeper, coaxing your body into a preserved sleep.

Ana Dandara cradled you, standing by a large window pane aboard the Cronus. All the travelers had boarded the ship, each saying their goodbyes before two years of sleep. Mars sat what looked like above them, the red rock that had been their home. Ana couldn&#39;t even see the colony from here. The planet looked the same as it had in those first images taken from flyby probes a century ago: naked and new, dead and timeless. Sitting amongst a profound silence. Ana Dandara thought of the miracle of your birth, how this place would hold the markers of that profound joy. Thought of how once the doctors were done with you, she cradled you not to differently to how she did now, but for the first time, thought of how she was one of the first mothers to hold a Martian in her arms.

Issac stood behind, preparing their sleepers for their trip. Ana asked him, without turning, &quot;Do you think they&#39;ll remember?&quot;

&quot;Remember what?&quot; asked Issac, not turning his head.

&quot;Anything of this place,&quot; she replied. &quot;Those barren rocks contain so much of me.&quot;

&quot;We can hope,&quot; Issac turned. &quot;Sometimes, I try to reach back and gather images from Earth. Not the ones from films or images, but my own. But I only come up with... snippets, single frames of memory. I&#39;m not even sure they&#39;re real.&quot; Issac walked to join you at the window. &quot;What do you remember?&quot;

Ana looked down into your eyes as they shifted from her face to the window to the corners of the room. This was the first time you experienced weightlessness. Your parents had prepared a sedative for what they thought would be inevitable tears. But, they never came.

You squirmed in her arms, confused. She never could imagine the stories her mother used to tell about Earth. She would always tell Ana about the inn she ran by a beach on the coast of Brazil. Ana thought about the stories her mother didn&#39;t tell, about what happened when the seas began to rise. About what they had to do to get on the ship to Mars. The stories she never had to tell, that Ana found as shards in offhand phrases and empty stares.

Issac turned back from the sleepers, looking past Ana and to the window. &quot;That&#39;s Earth, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Where?&quot; Ana looked out, for a dot a bit more blue than the rest, but found nothing. But Issac was the stargazer, not her.

He came to the window, putting his arm around Ana and pointed. &quot;There, I think. We should make sure the little one gets a good look.&quot;

Ana lifted you up a bit higher, bringing you to the window. Your eyes were wide.

Your helmet, half buried in sand blowing over its glass. Clouds in the sky, between the grains of sand being thrown at the canvas of the world by wind. And the red. The trees. Great leaves, riddled with webbed patterns. Light sprinkling down on you, lighting up the sand covering your sight, turning it into gold.

The sand shifts, rolling to one side. There&#39;s the sound of wind. You can feel it, in the tips of your fingers poking out from underneath the blanket of the sand. Even through the gloves. Somehow, this all feels familiar.

Using a free hand, you swipe away the remaining grains from your helmet, sending them into the air as well, bringing the world above you into view.

From the ground, the wooden branches spiral. They&#39;re knotted together, it&#39;s impossible to tell where they begin and end. The wood is a light pink, the leaves a deep red. Crimson. Or perhaps maroon. Your eyes sink into what almost looks like velvet growing off of the branches. Soft. Fluid. Your eyes are captivated upwards as you sit up, sand falling from your body.

There&#39;s stringy roots mixed together with the branches, rising up from the ground, connecting all the trunks among themselves, like webbing. This continues all the way up into what looks like a canopy, where the velvet leaves overtake the branches and roots.

Thin roots in front of you sprawl up from the ground, connecting to thick trunks floating above. They look like silver, graying hairs. Knotted and unkept, barely securing the trees to the sand that still stretches out endlessly before you. Looking through the mess of strings, it&#39;s impossible to see what&#39;s on the other side.

You grab for a branch to hold you still, but it slips from your fingers. You continue to spin, and your legs hit a nearby trunk. The edge of your boot easily slices through the wood. A white pus bubbles out from the gash, sticking to your boot.

&quot;CINDI, what do you think?&quot; asks Joana.

&quot;I see multiple options,&quot; says the AI. &quot;It appears the material produced by the root is acting as an adhesive, but the root is providing the solidity to keep the tear closed. I would recommend leaving a thin piece of the root, not removing it entirely. However, we have an extremely limited understanding of this ecosystem, another strategy would be to analyze this environment and attempt to guess what circumstances would leave the root and adhesive intact.&quot;

Looking up, you see the other end of the root stretch up through the nearby trunk and branches, the other open end floating nearby. All around you, the roots and branches loop around each other. The roots seem to connect randomly to different parts of the environment, but always connected to a larger circle.

&quot;Fuck that. I want it off,&quot; she says. &quot;Use the paste that fixed Joshua&#39;s helmet.&quot;

&quot;That could work,&quot; says CINDI. &quot;However, removing the root could cause a larger tear that the repair materials each suit is equipped with may not be able to handle. Perhaps with more equipment from the campsite or the ship, we could come up with a better solution.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t fucking know.&quot; Joana closes her eyes. &quot;Just make a choice. Just get me out of this.&quot;

&quot;CINDI, what do you think?&quot; asks Joana.

&quot;I see multiple options,&quot; says the AI. &quot;It appears the material produced by the root is acting as an adhesive, but the root is providing the solidity to keep the tear closed. I would recommend leaving a thin piece of the root, not removing it entirely. However, we have an extremely limited understanding of this ecosystem, another strategy would be to analyze this environment and attempt to guess what circumstances would leave the root and adhesive intact.&quot;

Looking up, you see the other end of the root stretch up through the nearby trunk and branches, the other open end floating nearby. All around you, the roots and branches loop around each other. The roots seem to connect randomly to different parts of the environment, but always connected to a larger circle.

&quot;Fuck that. I want it off,&quot; she says. &quot;Use the paste that fixed Joshua&#39;s helmet.&quot;

&quot;That could work,&quot; says CINDI. &quot;However, removing the root could cause a larger tear that the repair materials each suit is equipped with may not be able to handle. Perhaps with more equipment from the campsite or the ship, we could come up with a better solution.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t fucking know.&quot; Joana closes her eyes. &quot;Just make a choice. Just get me out of this.&quot;

Soon, you see the root begin to excrete small amounts of the white pus, connecting with the pool already on Joana&#39;s thigh. The root begins to take hold, connecting with its other end, completing the circuit.

The walk back is slow through the sand. It&#39;s darker, now that the sunlight is filtered through the trees. The winds are more violent, here. Sand kicks itself up to your helmet.

Issac wondered what sunsets on Earth felt like. He had seen what they looked like, in films and poetry. Like a squeezed orange drizzled down the atmosphere, he had once read. But that wasn&#39;t the same.

&quot;I want you to remember this,&quot; he whispers to the infant in his arms as the sun on the red planet begins to set. It was your last dusk on Mars and your 754th day outside of your mother&#39;s womb, and your father held you in his arms.

[[&quot;I want you to listen.&quot;]]

Looking down at your tiny body, held safe inside a specialized suit, Issac knew you wouldn&#39;t remember. So he listened for you. He listened to the rhythm of his lungs taking in air and taking out air, of his suit filtering out the used up air and putting oxygen back in. He listened to the crinkle the rock made between his heavy boots, and the special kind of quiet the blue haze made as it whispered its way down closer and closer to the horizon. The quiet seemed to sit all around him, even the rhythm of his breath slipping away as the sky slipped into the hum of twilight, and soon silence.

&quot;There it goes...&quot; Issac says as the last afterglow of the sun fades away. He hears you start to cry through the intercom connecting your two suits. &quot;Shh... shh... this is the best part.&quot;

The stars had found their way through the sky&#39;s inky blackness, punctures of white in the void that somehow always made their nightly appearance. As of late, Issac had taken to viewing the spectacle as a map, like Earth&#39;s navigators of old.

&quot;That&#39;s where we&#39;re going,&quot; he pointed up to a dot with an orange haze. &quot;To meet our neighbors.&quot;

It felt unreal, even saying it now. But the data was confirmed: microbial life found in a stream of liquid, jettisoned from an underground ocean on one of Saturn&#39;s moons. Alien life was now fact.

&quot;You and me, and your mom. We&#39;re the ones who get to go say hello.&quot; Issac&#39;s words swelled with wonder. You gurgled. 

&quot;There you are.&quot; She steps up from behind the both of you. &quot;Thought you might be out here.

Ana Dandara stands beside Issac, clunkyly putting her arm around him. Both your parents stand with you, in the dark of the Martian night. All wallowing in the quiet and the starlight.

&quot;Did you ever... hate your mother, for taking you here? Away from Earth?&quot; asks Issac.

&quot;I did,&quot; says Ana. &quot;But... I understood. I&#39;d seen enough to know I couldn&#39;t stay.&quot;

[[&quot;I always imagined Earth as this perfect place.&quot;]]

Looking down at your tiny body, held safe inside a specialized suit, Issac knew you wouldn&#39;t remember. So he watched for you. He watched as a haze of blue and gray blanketed the sky and the mountains and the dust. This was the last time he would see this site, he knew. This image only lasting in the canals of memory, easily tarnished. Easily replaced. He watched as the landscape soaked up all the light of day, as it was dipped in twilight, where it would sit and sog for some time before drowning into night. Soon, there was darkness.

&quot;There it goes...&quot; Issac says as the last afterglow of the sun fades away. The wisps of red dirt and brown rock around them had all turned equally inky gray. The silhouettes of the distant mountains clawed up towards the heavenly sky. He hears you start to cry through the intercom connecting your two suits. &quot;Shh... shh... this is the best part.&quot;

Even though I knew what had become of it. I couldn&#39;t stand living in a cave.&quot;

&quot;Now, you won&#39;t,&quot; she says. &quot;And neither will our child.&quot;

Night had fully settled into itself. The temperature was dropping rapidly. The suits would keep them warm, but nevertheless, they would need their rest for the coming day.

&quot;We should head back inside,&quot; said Ana.

&quot;You go on ahead, I&#39;ll join after a moment.&quot; Issac handed you over to Ana, and she took you back towards their habitat, up a short set of stairs hewn into the side of a basin. Issac remained, to savor his last evening on the planet.

In the quiet and in the dark, Issac sunk himself into time, lodging himself into this particular moment. The wisps of red dirt and brown rock all equally inky gray. The silhouettes of the distant mountains clawing up towards the heavenly sky. And the stars. Piercing through some thin fabric to rain and speckle and shine among us, just for a time. Issac knew he would soon know those stars very well. 

&quot;Hello, Issac.&quot; He knows that voice. But not like this. Not here, not yet.

&quot;Ezra,&quot; he says. There&#39;s a hand that falls on his shoulder, as the sand and rock kicked into the air by the wind seems to freeze. He remembers that voice. &quot;Already?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid so,&quot; he says. Voice heavy. It all comes back to Issac, as he turn to face him.

&quot;How far have you gone?&quot; asks Issac. His eyes notice the stars don&#39;t seem to be twinkling.

&quot;Far enough, I think.&quot; It seems as if he might say more, but he holds back.

Issac looks down. Unable to bring his eyes to Ezra&#39;s. &quot;Why are you here?&quot; he asks.

&quot;To ask you a question.&quot; He lifts Issac&#39;s chin, forcing their eyes to meet. Ezra&#39;s not wearing a suit, only a Proxima uniform. He breathes the air without fear. There&#39;s a rare vulnerability in his eyes, his words. &quot;I wanted to come here, before it all begins. Before you arrive.&quot;

&quot;Ask your question.&quot;

The hand on Issac&#39;s chin slides to his cheek. &quot;Will you forgive me?&quot;

There&#39;s complete silence, as the words hang on the still air. No sounds from Issac&#39;s suit. From the underground habitats nearby. There&#39;s only the knowing of what he has done. And the question.

Ezra puts his own hand above Issac&#39;s. &quot;Good.&quot; He nods to himself.

The stars begin to stutter into sparkling, again. Ezra looks up, even as he seems to be fading. Issac can&#39;t stop his gaze from following. &quot;Soon, it won&#39;t just be our hearts, Issac. I&#39;ve made sure of it.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; There&#39;s a thirst and a terror in his eyes as he looks up. The stars like diamonds. Sharp. Shining far to bright. &quot;Ezra--&quot;

Slowly, he lets Issac&#39;s hand fall. The stars begin to stutter into sparkling, again. Ezra looks up, even as he seems to be fading. Issac can&#39;t stop his gaze from following. &quot;We&#39;ll get there, Issac. I&#39;ve made sure of it.&quot;

The billowing of your habitat brings you out of your sleep. The sound, first. The wind&#39;s whistle, far stronger than you&#39;d felt it the day before. And the cloth, turbulent even from the inside. Your suit thrown about as you open your eyes. The habitat&#39;s constraints holding you to one side.

It takes a moment for your suit to adjust its temperature modulation systems accordingly. There&#39;s a crunch as your foot steps down on solid ice. Your boots need to dig into it slightly to stay secured to the floor.

The landscape is recognizable, but barely. There&#39;s still a shoreline. Thicker chunks of rock are mixed in with the sand. Some chunks of ice. The anchors of your habitats, placed close to the water&#39;s shore, are now partly frozen into the ground.

At first glance, there&#39;s no trace of the forest, only lifeless tundra. Soft particles of a frozen liquid hang in the air, buffeted by the wind toward the inland.

The frozen water stretches out before climbing to larger formations. The ice cliff-faces appear to be simple glaciers at first glance, but the longer you stare, you notice intricate and ornate structures. It&#39;s impossible to tell exactly what with the wind and alien snow.

The sound of the crunches beneath your feet begin to change, reaching a higher pitch.

Sarah occasionally will take a sample of the soil. Once you reach what was once the edge of the forest, there&#39;s the occasional fossilized sign of a tree. Circular branches etched into rock, preserved by snow and ice. Ringlets of what now seems ancient, and yet was yesterday.

&quot;These remains... they should be millions of years old,&quot; says Sarah. &quot;The samples of bark we took yesterday were... thousands at most.&quot;

More of these fossilized remains appear the further you go into the forest. They&#39;re not all branches, some are the imprints of leaves. You and Sarah spread out, walking among the mummified corpses of the trees.

&quot;Yeah. She&#39;s gone.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s all I need to know.&quot; Images creep into your mind, of what could have happened to her, but you push that away.

As you start to walk away, Sarah joins you. Together, you travel [[back to the shore.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="698" name="&quot;I think I do.&quot;" tags="ch5" position="32193,2947" size="100,100">&quot;I think I do.&quot; You walk over.

Sarah is leaning over what at first looks like another one of the fossilized trees. It takes a moment before you notice the lines in the rock resemble a face, certain crevices the edge of a cheek, a knot round like an eye. Jagged teeth lodged inside.

You see the components, but their no longer shaped the right way. They rotate about each other, as if someone had spun a face around and around and around until it was a soup, and then frozen it in rock.

There&#39;s a moment when you don&#39;t recognize the shapes as that of your sister where you think it might be beautiful. The moment passes and only the nausea remains.

[[Walk away.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="699" name="Cover it back up with snow." tags="ch5" position="32369,3049" size="100,100">You lean down, and push the snow around the area over the fossil. Sarah helps as well. Soon, there&#39;s nothing but peaceful snow. Sarah stands, hand on your shoulder, and helps you up.

It&#39;s hard to see, and though the suits keep you warm enough, the cold is still very much present. At the tips of your gloves. The ice at the edges of your helmet.

You&#39;re both silent, following the markings on the ice floor. The only sound the crunching of the ice. Hours pass. The glacial formations in the distance grow closer. It&#39;s not one solid glacier, you start to see gaps. The ice shifts and reflects. You keep walking toward it.

Soon, you see the figures of Yusuf and Teenesee on the horizon. Sarah calls out, and they wait for you. They ask if you found Joana, already knowing the answer. Sarah replies so you don&#39;t have to. The walking begins again.

The sound of the crunches beneath your feet begin to change, reaching a higher pitch.

&quot;And I suppose you want to use my drone?&quot; says Yusuf, with a scowl.

&quot;It&#39;s technically not your drone, just because you&#39;re carrying it,&quot; says Sarah.

Yusuf pulls out a small disk shape from his pack, places it carefully into the air. There&#39;s a semi-circular strip he pulls off of one end, which snaps into a control mechanism.

Yusuf swerves his arms, and the drone follows. Leaning his hands forward, the drone moves towards the opening.

He opens a visual feed, projected between the two controls in his hand, showing the view from the drone. You watch over Yusuf&#39;s shoulder.

He lowers his arms, directing the drone down into the water. You watch as the barren landscape of the surface transforms into a dazzling cascade of lights, shining through the light into the water below. It&#39;s beautiful, even though the light is dim.

&quot;Let&#39;s collect these samples and move on,&quot; says Yusuf.

&quot;Go deeper,&quot; says Sarah. &quot;If there&#39;s a floor not to far, we&#39;re much more likely to find biological material there.&quot;

Yusuf sighs and directs the drone lower into the water. There&#39;s less light, the further the drone goes down, but not many other changes. But the view begins to shake the deeper the drone goes, making it nearly impossible to see anything clearly.

&quot;Why are you moving it like that?&quot; she asks.

&quot;I&#39;m-- I&#39;m not!&quot; Yusuf replies. &quot;It&#39;s the current, it&#39;s--&quot;

The screen freezes and then goes black. &quot;We have lost connection to the drone,&quot; says CINDI.

&quot;Perfect. Great idea for a detour. I&#39;m going to find Joshua.&quot;

Yusuf&#39;s already forging ahead, and the rest follow. There are more holes, but you avoid them this time. They grow smaller, thinner as you approach the structures in the distance. Soon, they&#39;re gone altogether, and the ice is flat. It seems bluer than before, thinner perhaps. Teenesee takes a step, and leaves a crack in the ice. After that, everyone walks more carefully. Joshua must have as well, the prints became more and more faint. But Yusuf still manages to hold onto the trail.

The structures rise, large and rounded pillars. Once you reach the base of the first, they grow even stranger. Each is slightly different than the other. The first are small, but soon grow larger and more complex. Some are rough, others perfectly smooth. Some with a base, others lodged into the ground. But they all hold an eerily familiar oval shape, like a stretched out skipping stone.

The structures are all concentrating to one spot, circling out from there. As you get closer, it looks as if what is at that central point is just another one of the pillars. But beneath the ice, there&#39;s a silver shine. Long legs stretch out from it to keep it stable. It&#39;s your ship, coated in ice, but clearly there.

[[&quot;It&#39;s still there.&quot;]]

Sarah nods, and the two of you make your way towards the ship.

As you approach the ship, you think back to that first night, the shallow water, the twin moons. Looking up, clouds obscure most of the sky. 

&quot;CINDI, open the airlock.&quot; There&#39;s a roar as the ship&#39;s gears shift, breaking away the ice coating the underbelly of the ship. The doors open directly above you, and you [[jump onto the ship.-&gt;Jump onto the ship.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="713" name="Jump onto the ship." tags="ch5" position="32037,4018" size="100,100">You push up from the ground, detaching, and fly up into the airlock. As soon as you pass the threshold, you feel warmer and more at ease, even as you crash into the closed blast doors on the opposite side of the airlock. Soon, you grab hold of the handle there and steady yourself. Looking to the side, you see Sarah&#39;s done the same.

&quot;We&#39;re in, CINDI,&quot; she says. You hear the rumble again, as the doors close.

You reorient yourself, placing your feet on solid ground to face the doors. The compartment is flooded with breathable air, decompressing gas, and toxins to preserve the environment within the ship. Soon, the inward doors open, and you&#39;re inside once more.

It&#39;s the same as you left it. The pods, still there, either empty or filled with corpses. The stale beauty of &quot;brand new&quot; after drifting through space time. Sarah rushes over to the computers, already looking for the data you need.

[[Walk over to your mother&#39;s cryo chamber.]]

The frost on the glass is almost all melted, and beneath you can quietly watch your mother.

She looks calm, rested. So different from the face you&#39;ve seen in your memories. Her hair cut down close to her scalp. Eyelids gently folded down. Lips relaxed, her neck sinking into the padding of the cryo chamber.

[[Open the sleeper.]]
[[Leave the sleeper alone.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="715" name="Open the sleeper." tags="ch5" position="31682,4273" size="100,100">You put your hand on the glass, it&#39;s scanned briefly.

Confusion. Nothing crossed her face. Still serene.

The glass opens, and a stale smell wafts up. You see her arms tucked in at her side, strapped down inside the chamber. It&#39;s strange, how still she is. Bodies are never that still.

&quot;Some of it,&quot; she says. &quot;We&#39;ve collected $bioSamples samples, filling about $canNum of our cannisters. But... what we found, on Enceladus, what we built our engine around was just one specific microbe. Here, we&#39;ve picked up... thousands of different species, in each of our samples. It&#39;s hard to know what will and won&#39;t work with our engine.&quot;

The console is large, with dozens of windows open alongside each other. Most displaying complex molecular structures, others topographic data from the drones and schematics of the //Prodromos// and Exodus Drive.

&quot;This planet can look desolate, but it&#39;s... teeming with life, in its soil and water and air. It&#39;ll take years... lifetimes to properly research everything we&#39;ve found.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s one way they seem to be similar to microbiology as it should be,&quot; she says. &quot;Or... how I think it should be.

But the activating agent within seems to be subduing them.&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s complicated,&quot; says Sarah. She pulls up half a dozen sets of molecular structures. &quot;There&#39;s the obvious differences between microbial species... separate protein structures, organelles, some are bacteria, others are fungi -- there&#39;s a lot going on.&quot;

She picks one of these structures, and expands it, while hiding the others. With a brush of her hand, a line of repeating structures expands out. &quot;But let&#39;s take a look at one of these species. This is data collected from samples over the last few days that clearly are a part of the same species. But, their mutations make no sense.&quot;

You start to notice small aberrations from one image to the next. &quot;There&#39;s the obvious, that none of this should be able to happen this fast, on the scale of days. But even if we ignore that... everything&#39;s out of order. Mutation and evolution has to build and change what came before. 

&quot;We have four days of data, including today. Which isn&#39;t enough to make conclusive statements, but I&#39;ll conjecture with what we have. Samples from our first night on this planet show a host of functions not even hinted at in any day since-- the ability to survive with little to no light or energy, have complex communications, survive independently or co-dependently.

&quot;But the samples from the next day seemed to revert, containing almost none of these traits, despite having the same originating structure. There&#39;s a more natural progression to the third day&#39;s samples, from the forest biome, but look at this.&quot;

She highlights the examples from the second and third days. &quot;In the forest biome, this microbial species was able to biologically link with the environments fauna, as if they were living symbolically. That&#39;s normal. Life at all scales on Earth evolves to be codependent. Here, the microbe has enzymes that allow it to share energy with the plant structures. But now, look back to our Day 2 samples.&quot;

She points back to the analysis on the left. &quot;That enzyme -- and others -- aren&#39;t developed yet, but its structure is already making space for them. Before there was any sign of plantlife. It&#39;s like the mutation was... anticipatory. I&#39;ve never seen anything like that.&quot;

All the biochemistry is over your head, but you can see the spaces in the webbing of the microbial structure from the image on the left seems to be filled on the right. And the spaces seem specific, carved out among the microscopic patterns of the single-celled-organism&#39;s structure.

[[&quot;It&#39;s a coincidence.&quot;]]

&quot;It&#39;s all gone,&quot; she says. &quot;There&#39;s even less complexity and structure than from our Day 2 samples. But still... there&#39;s the shapes of what was there the day before. In the same way the Day 2 samples showed the shapes of what was to come.&quot;

&quot;It could be,&quot; she says. &quot;Especially with such little data, all of this could be an anomaly... that&#39;s the most likely answer. But I&#39;ve never seen any organism... prepare itself for genetic mutation like this. Evolution happens because of trial and error. Not foresight.&quot;

Vague memories of physics simulations and free body diagrams come and go as you try and grasp what might happen when you make contact with the ground. Will you bounce up into the sky? Slide across the surface? Will the force be strong enough to break your bones?

Your speed has decreased, but even under the water you&#39;re still sinking. The crack in your helmet splintering at the increased pressure of the water. A stream of water is beginning to leak through, floating in your helmet in globs.

Joshua lifts from the floor, floating and fighting to keep a straight face as his lungs gasp for oxygen, filling themselves with the air of this alien world. But there&#39;s little pain, other than that. The occasional smile pushes through and, once the gasping is done, that&#39;s all that remains.

You&#39;re oriented enough to tell you&#39;re heading towards a blue layer of ice. Vague memories of physics simulations and free body diagrams come and go as you try and grasp what might happen when you make contact with the ground. Will you bounce up into the sky? Slide across the surface? Will the force be strong enough to break your bones?

The answer comes to you in shards, as you break through the ice surface and find yourself plunged into freezing water just underneath. A million fires light up your body at contact with the surface. Cold devours you, even as the suit attempts to flood you with heat.

Your speed has decreased, but even under the water you&#39;re still sinking. The crack in your helmet splintering at the increased pressure of the water. A stream of water is beginning to leak through, floating in your helmet in globs.

[[Swim up.]]
[[Fix your suit.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="793" name="Swim up." tags="ch5" position="33098,7722" size="100,100">Legs and hands try and push the water down below you to propel yourself up, but with no luck. The suit is far too clunky, and your descent far too strong. The water continues to enter, one glob sticking to your left cheek. The bubbles from the opening rise up as you sink.

[[Look around you.]]

For a moment or two, you manage to plug the hole, but it doesn&#39;t last. The water finds a way around your gloved hand. One glob sticks to your left cheek. Reaching to your pack, you try and grab the emergency adhesive. You open the pack, but all the contents spill out into the water, joining the bubbles rising from the opening as you sink.

[[Look around you.]]
[[Close your eyes.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="795" name="Look around you." tags="ch5" position="33298,7825" size="100,100">You try and look around. It&#39;s difficult with the damage to the helmet and water you&#39;re taking on. There&#39;s the gap in the ice you fell through above, and what look like strange lights surrounding you. It&#39;s hard to tell if they&#39;re actually there or it&#39;s just your oxygen deprived mind.

[[Keep breathing.]]
[[Hold your breath.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="796" name="Close your eyes." tags="ch5" position="33331,7690" size="100,100">You close your eyes tight. The cold latched on at your cheek is slowly growing, as if it were a cancer, spreading. Another fleck hits your chin. A larger pool finds your forehead. The hiss of the water rings in your ears. As droplets of water brush against your lips you think it must taste sweet. It&#39;s hard to tell if that&#39;s actually the case or it&#39;s just your depraved mind.

[[Keep breathing.]]

I never knew what peace was until that moment. As your mind came to an acceptance of this thing called death. Tried to reconcile it with everything you knew, everything you knew you didn&#39;t know. All the things you felt but didn&#39;t have the words or memories for.

The jagged edges of your sharded memories lay close, and you clutch them. With every strength your fading body has, you hold them close as you sense the end. Taking each edge, trying to fit it to another. The gaps begin to take some kind of shape. And from that, you think, it must be enough. It must be enough.

There’s a young girl, hands stretched out, face towards the sky. Toes tickled by the water.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Procurei você o dia todo. E agora, você está aqui na praia? Preciso da sua ajuda.

There’s a mother, lifting her dress to walk across the beach sand in her bare feet.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Tems algo a dizer?”&quot;&gt;&gt;“Do you have anything to say?”&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

The waves of the beach come and come again, bringing more creatures to shore and returning others to the ocean. The mother sits down next to her daughter, helping her lean up against her.

Something wet hit her nose. Another on her finger. From the sky, flecks of white drizzle down, lazily. The mother’s face grows small as she stands.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Vamos, Ana. Vamos pra dentro.”&quot;&gt;&gt;“Come, Ana. Come on inside.”&lt;&lt;linkreplace&gt;&gt;

She lifts her daughter, and walks back towards the house near the shore, through the sand and snow. Glancing down when she can, so not to disturb the creatures burying themselves deep into the Earth, hiding from the cold. And from everything still to come.

Teenesee leans down to try and help Sarah up. In her eyes, you see she too feels the twisting pain of the radiation contorting her cells. &quot;She&#39;s dying,&quot; her lips read. The traditional short range communication is blocked, leaving only harsh static.
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
&quot;All... dying.&quot; The words are almost coughed up by Sarah.

Eyes open, and you&#39;re back on the riverbank. The soft trickle of water as it meanders down, tickling your ears. It&#39;s this same place, this land, a few thousands of years later, that will be transformed into a coffin for your friends. You think, how can I then say time has no meaning? Time, that can demolish mountains, soak up rivers, unleash horrors?

Well. Time has only the power you give it. And you give it so much.

You can see both worlds, now. The picturesque riverside of your physical world and the images being sent to you from Sarah&#39;s mind through the quantum world. You look around, at the objects, at the habitats softly floating in the wind. You close your eyes, and see your crew collapsed on the floor.

&quot;Can&#39;t die,&quot; Sarah says. &quot;Have to see home.&quot;

Home. That is a word we understand more than death. Where is home? I ask Sarah.

Sarah&#39;s fingers grasp at the ground. Through the gloves of her suit, she feels the dry dirt crack and crumble.

//Yes, Sarah. We made a home, beneath the surface. Shielded from the radiation. Not all of us, some on the surface simply... changed. But most have laced themselves throughout the very fabric of this planet, its oceans, soil, magma, metal. We saw the flares that would plague this planet the very moment we saw its death trillions of years from now, the same moment we began to germinate on this very shore. So we knew to find protection from what surrounds us. Or, to accept the mutation and change. There was never any other way.//

Eyes open again and the world grows quiet. &quot;Make shelter,&quot; Sarah croaks, her voice and the pain you hear in it distant as you look up at the perpetual sunset of a calm star, its deep red light showering you in a comfortable glow. &quot;In the past. For us now. Use the ground.&quot;

[[Go to the habitats.]]

&quot;Of course I would,&quot; you say, hoping you won&#39;t be proven wrong.

The image begins to distort. You feel the echoes of sharp pain twisting within your gut. Confusion. A voice, like Sarah&#39;s but... not exactly as you hear it. &quot;Should... protect.&quot;

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

Fingers tingle with the sensation of fabric. Brushing across the exterior of a suit. Hear Sarah&#39;s voice. &quot;And these will protect us from the flares?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ll protect you from everything.&quot; The voice is Ezra&#39;s. &quot;The flares, temperature fluctuations, liquids and any harmful gas. And you&#39;ve overseen their sanitation and bacterial sealing yourself. You&#39;ll be completely cut off, nothing can touch you.&quot; He smiles, comfortingly.

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $Joana is &quot;alive&quot; and $Yusuf is &quot;alive&quot;&gt;&gt;\
You snap back to Sarah&#39;s confusion and pain. Eyes move up from the ground, you see three figures before you, one holding the others.
&lt;&lt;elseif $Joana is &quot;alive&quot; and $Yusuf is &quot;dead&quot;&gt;&gt;\
You snap back to Sarah&#39;s confusion and pain. Eyes move up from the ground, you see two figures before you, one holding the other.

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $Joana is &quot;alive&quot; and $stateJoana is &quot;looped&quot;&gt;&gt;\
&quot;Joana...&quot; thinks Sarah. Teenesee is carrying her, struggling with the roots now woven around her entire suit. The once milky white color is wilting, burning black under the direct exposure to the radiation beating down from the star&#39;s flare. As Teenesee brings Joana closer to Sarah, you can see Joana is unconscious.
&lt;&lt;elseif $Joana is &quot;alive&quot; and $stateJoana is &quot;bulbed&quot;&gt;&gt;\
&quot;Joana...&quot; thinks Sarah. Teenesee is carrying her, struggling with her limp body. The once milky white color of the bulbed stub of what was once a root is wilting, burning black under the direct exposure to the radiation beating down from the star&#39;s flare. As Teenesee brings Joana closer to Sarah, you see gaps where her flesh is exposed, peeling and festering as Joana remains unconscious.

Teenesee leans down to try and help Sarah up. In her eyes, you see she too feels the twisting pain of the radiation contorting her cells. &quot;She&#39;s dying,&quot; her lips read. The traditional short range communication is blocked, leaving only harsh static.
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
&quot;We&#39;re all dying,&quot; Sarah thinks. Probably tries to say.

Eyes open, and you&#39;re back on the riverbank. The soft trickle of water as it meanders down, tickling your ears. It&#39;s this same place, this land, a few thousands of years later, that will be transformed into a coffin for your friends. You think, how can I then say time has no meaning? Time, that can demolish mountains, soak up rivers, unleash horrors?

Well. Time has only the power you give it. And you give it so much.

&quot;Help us,&quot; Sarah thinks, as radiation poisons her insides. You can see both, now. The picturesque riverside of your physical world and the images being sent to you from Sarah&#39;s mind through the quantum world. 

 She hopes that CINDI is transferring these messages from her mind to you, but she barely understands quantum-communications as is, without the time travel involved. And yet, she holds on hope, without a plan, or even understanding of how it could be done. But the thought reaches you, thousands of years in the past. &quot;If you can hear this, wherever you are in the past, do something to help us.&quot;

You look around, at the objects, at the habitats softly floating in the wind. You close your eyes, and see your crew collapsed on the floor.

&quot;I can&#39;t die,&quot; Sarah thinks. Not for you, this time. &quot;I... have to see home again.&quot;

Home. That is a word we understand more than death. Where is home? I ask Sarah.

&quot;Home is...&quot; Her thoughts cease to be words. Instead, there&#39;s the weight of dirt placed in your hands, black and mulched. Soft, comforting.

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;This is ours,&quot; says an older voice. Piercing hazel eyes. &quot;Always will be, and we belong to it as well. Regardless of what law and paper tell us. Regardless of who claims to have taken it. You lean down, scoop up this soil, this land, know our roots run deep. That does not mean we own it, or it owns us. But you know each other.&quot;

The wrinkled hands let go and leave the soil to sit in your fingers. &quot;So I will stay. Come what will, I will stay with my home. All my life I have protected it, the best I can, and I trust in the years I have left, it will protect me.&quot;

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

Sarah&#39;s fingers grasp at the ground. Through the gloves of her suit, she feels the dry dirt crack and crumble. &quot;The earth. You all made a home... beneath the surface, shielded from the radiation.&quot;

//Yes, Sarah. Though not all of us. Some on the surface simply... changed. But most have laced themselves throughout the very fabric of this planet, its oceans, soil, magma, metal. We saw the flares that would plague this planet the very moment we saw its death trillions of years from now, the same moment we began to germinate on this very shore. So we knew to find protection from what surrounds us. Or, to accept the mutation and change. There was never any other way.//

Eyes open again and the world grows quiet. &quot;$name, you have to do something.&quot; There&#39;s another wince of pain as you hear her voice, but it feels distant now, as you look up at the perpetual sunset of a calm star, its deep red light showering you in a comfortable glow. &quot;From the past, something that&#39;ll allow us to find shelter now.&quot;

The rectangular base covers thickly tired wheels, lodged in the mud. The base then slants into what is almost a triangular prism, until it rounds out at the top. There, a circle sits at the top.

Hand brushes against the cold metal of the device&#39;s side. A control screen appears.

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;This is what Mom used to do,&quot; says Joana, holding you in her arms. You can&#39;t speak, but you can feel the cold of the machine&#39;s metal as your sister brings you close to it. &quot;She&#39;d push this button here,&quot; she said, pulling up the control screen, &quot;and a laser would come out from that end, and... all the rock would disappear, giving us a place to call home. Without her, we wouldn&#39;t have caves big enough for us all to live in. That&#39;s what she told us, anyway.&quot;

Joana looked around, the cave well lit by phosphorescent cabling above them. &quot;Uncle says its important to know why we&#39;re here, so I thought I&#39;d show you, so you know before you go.&quot;

She leans down to the floor, gently bringing you with her, turning you so she can see your face. &quot;It&#39;s not fair.&quot; There&#39;s water welling up in her eyes, so she closes them. &quot;I was... so excited, to see you grow up. Have a friend, here.&quot; Joana&#39;s face smiles, thinking about that world, where you both grew up together. &quot;If I see you again, it&#39;ll be... when we&#39;re both boring and grown up. Forgetting... where we came from, and we won&#39;t even have each other to help remember.&quot;

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

The whirring continues, growing in intensity, piercing the silence of the riverside.

A bright white light suddenly protrudes from the drill, and pierces the ground. The dirt of the riverbank swiftly melts away, and soon the laser hits a rocky layer several feet beneath. The drill&#39;s progress slows, but is still steady, chipping away at the material.

Teenesee makes her way over to Sarah, and leans down. Her movements are awkward and staggered. But she manages to fumble her way down, bringing her helmet before Sarah&#39;s. Her lips are moving. &quot;Tell him,&quot; you read, &quot;we will live.&quot;

Immediately she stands, thrusting herself up. And slowly, makes her way towards the drill, sitting in their time, in the same place it sits beside you. Sarah leans up as well.

Teenesee reaches the drill, and begins to point it toward the ground, frantically pushing at the controls. A cylinder emerges from the top of the device, stretching out about an inch. The protruding end opens.

A bright white light suddenly emerges from the drill, and pierces the ground. The laser hits the rocky floor with force, beginning to slowly chip away at the material.

Sarah still is looking up from the ground. &quot;You&#39;re not... nothing&#39;s going to save us, is it?&quot; she thinks. &quot;You don&#39;t want to use the drill.&quot; The flare continues to pulse, new loops spilling out from its arc across the sky. &quot;I&#39;d agree, if it wasn&#39;t for everything we&#39;ve already done. &lt;&lt;if $funeral is &quot;yes&quot;&gt;&gt;Dumping corpses into the ice.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $Joana is &quot;alive&quot;&gt;&gt;Melding Joana with a tree.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; We already fucked this up.

&lt;&lt;if $Joana is &quot;alive&quot; and $Yusuf is &quot;dead&quot;&gt;&gt;\
She leans forward, and sees Teenesee attempting to take Joana&#39;s life signatures as she lies on the ground as well. Head turns, she looks to Sarah. &quot;She knows,&quot; says CINDI. &quot;She knows you&#39;re doing nothing.&quot;
&lt;&lt;elseif $Yusuf is &quot;alive&quot; and $Joana is &quot;dead&quot;&gt;&gt;\
She leans forward, and sees Teenesee attempting to keep Yusuf awake as he lies on the ground as well. Head turns, she looks to Sarah. &quot;She knows,&quot; says CINDI. &quot;She knows you&#39;re doing nothing.&quot;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\

Teenesee makes her way over to Sarah, and leans down. Her movements are awkward and staggered. But she manages to fumble her way down, bringing her helmet before Sarah&#39;s. Her lips are moving. &quot;Tell him,&quot; you read, &quot;we will live.&quot;

Immediately she stands, thrusting herself up. And slowly, makes her way towards the drill, sitting in their time, in the same place it sits beside you. Sarah leans up as well.

Teenesee reaches the drill, and begins to point it toward the ground, frantically pushing at the controls. A cylinder emerges from the top of the device, stretching out about an inch. The protruding end opens.

A bright white light suddenly emerges from the drill, and pierces the ground. The laser hits the rocky floor with force, beginning to slowly chip away at the material.

Sarah pushes herself to stand, shakily, and Teenesee walks back to steady her. The drill continues to dig into the ground.

&lt;&lt;if $Joana is &quot;dead&quot; and $Yusuf is &quot;dead&quot;&gt;&gt;\
Together, they walk back toward the drill. Sarah clutches onto it, and looking over, sees a small dent has been made in the floor, but barely enough to fit someone inside of, much less shield from the sun&#39;s radiation.

&lt;&lt;if $Joana is &quot;alive&quot; and $Yusuf is &quot;dead&quot;&gt;&gt;\
Together, they lift up Joana&#39;s limp body, and walk back toward the drill. Sarah clutches onto it, and looking over, sees a small dent has been made in the floor, but barely enough to fit someone inside of, much less shield from the sun&#39;s radiation.

&lt;&lt;if $Joana is &quot;dead&quot; and $Yusuf is &quot;alive&quot;&gt;&gt;\
Together, they lift up Yusuf, and walk back toward the drill. Sarah clutches onto it, and looking over, sees a small dent has been made in the floor, but barely enough to fit someone inside of, much less shield from the sun&#39;s radiation.

&lt;&lt;if $Joana is &quot;alive&quot; and $Yusuf is &quot;alive&quot;&gt;&gt;\
Together, they lift up Joana, and with Yusuf&#39;s help, and walk back toward the drill. Sarah clutches onto it, and looking over, sees a small dent has been made in the floor, but barely enough to fit someone inside of, much less shield from the sun&#39;s radiation.
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\

&quot;It will take too long,&quot; says CINDI, &quot;for the drill to penetrate the surface enough to shield them. They&#39;re already dying.&quot;

Teenesee&#39;s hands are trembling, she&#39;s barely able to keep moving the drill forward. Beneath her helmet you see glimpses of peeling, burnt skin. And it&#39;ll only get worse.You don&#39;t want to see this.

&quot;No, Captain. I believe you do need to see this.&quot; There is no change. Even with your eyes open, you can barely see what&#39;s in front of you. The images from Sarah are too strong.

Teenesee pulls her beam emitter out, and uses that to puncture the ground alongside the drill. Sarah &lt;&lt;if $Yusuf is &quot;alive&quot;&gt;&gt;and Yusuf &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;do the same.

We have always known how we will, as you call it, die. The star you call Proxima Centauri will continue to burn and burn for trillions of years. It will grow dimmer, and cold, and there will not be enough energy for us to take in to continue to live, no matter how well integrated we have become.

This has already happened. We do not mourn it. It is not a bookend to birth, it is the same. Fear of reaching that point will never push us to do anything we would not do otherwise. We do not attempt to grapple with what is known.

Well. Didn&#39;t have that. I guess that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing now, isn&#39;t it? Trying to hold on.

The outlines of Sarah and Teenesee shimmer to life from within the tunnel, projecting out from your suit. They look startled, as they see you appear in their time. The projection broadens, taking the data from Sarah&#39;s suit, and projecting it across the tunnel. Now, you see it as they do.

&quot;We don&#39;t have much time. We need to focus on the task at hand,&quot; says Sarah. She&#39;s holding a sensor from her portable lab, emitting a soft glow in the dark of the tunnel. It&#39;s picking up traces of us, all around. &quot;This is...&quot;

&quot;The tunnel... if this instrumentation is still working right, the walls all around us are lined with bacteria.&quot; Sarah looks up, her headlamp following her sight as it moves around. The interlacing grooves seem to shimmer slightly. &quot;We should turn our lights off.&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t have much time, we can debrief later. We need to focus on the task at hand,&quot; says Sarah. She&#39;s holding a sensor from her portable lab, emitting a soft glow in the dark of the tunnel. It&#39;s picking up traces of us, all around. &quot;This is...&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; asks Teenesee.

&quot;The tunnel... if this instrumentation is still working right, the walls all around us are lined with bacteria.&quot; Sarah looks up, her headlamp following her sight as it moves around. The interlacing grooves seem to shimmer slightly. &quot;We should turn our lights off.&quot;

Her light goes out, Teenesee&#39;s soon after. In a moment it&#39;s complete darkness.

You [[go inside.-&gt;Go in.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1065" name="Go in." tags="ch7m" position="47816,5811" size="100,100">You walk through the door, and it slides upwards, letting you into the lab. You&#39;ve been here many times before, but never like this. The central table is occupied by a massive device. You count at least six power sources connected to it by frayed wiring. Several beakers have been inserted to one side of it, and several others lie broken, oozing liquid dripping from the device, to the table, and painfully slowly to the floor. You watch, as one droplet garners enough force from the moon&#39;s gravity to break from the static connection with the table. It moves in a straight line, down. But it takes its time. For a coloniazable body, Enceladus is fairly low in mass, and thus gravitational pool. A droplet of primordial ooze, even compared to that, is nothing at all. The drop did not fall quickly. Instead, it lingered, like a tear that cannot be wiped away, and fell, as you noticed the rest of the scene.

These broken beakers littered the room, the ooze decorating much of the surfaces. Something happened, that was clear. But now, all was silence. You almost didn&#39;t notice the back of your father&#39;s head as he sat in a chair, without moving a muscle. Barely breathing.

He pours himself a glass, the liquid floating inside the sealed container. Joshua raises his glass to Elliot, who slowly does the same. They both put their lips to the seal, opening the container allowing the liquid to be sucked in.

The nearly silent whoosh of the door cuts through the scene. You turn to see Ana Dandara with two members of station security, and medical personnel. She immediately turns her attention to the broken test tubes and material spread throughout the room.

&quot;This laboratory is under a high-security lockdown until further notice,&quot; she says to the security officers. &quot;Everyone who has made contact with the environment must be quarantined.&quot;

The medical professionals pull up masks and move towards Issac. His eyes scream fear.

&quot;I just need to speak. I don&#39;t need quarantine.&quot; As he is pulled up by his arms, it looks as if every joint in his body is breaking out of a stiff, frozen sleep. &quot;Let me finish talking to my son. Let me talk to my wife.&quot;

&quot;We need to get you help, before anything else. We can talk soon.&quot; Ana keeps her distance, still under the door&#39;s threshold.

&quot;Memory alteration. During cryo. It&#39;s simple, a tested technology. Known to help patients with really bad PTSD, stuff like that. People who have shit they want to forget.

Ana notices that amid the hand gestures he uses to explain the concept, his fingers are shaking slightly.

&quot;CINDI&#39;s already scanning through the crew&#39;s memory systems to pinpoint those moments. That data is sent to a neurologist, who identifies the neurons that need to be altered. And, when everyone&#39;s in cryo, a special addition to the sleepers takes care of the rest.&quot;

He looks at the telescope, starts idly fiddling with it. The optical tube squeaking as its moved back and forth.

&quot;Oh, and then CINDI deletes any record of having done it at all. Good as new. Our colonists arrive with no qualms about the samples they&#39;re collecting and the mission goes forth as planned.&quot;

&quot;Will you remember? When we wake up?&quot; she asks the air.

&quot;No,&quot; replies CINDI. &quot;Knowledge of Issac&#39;s death, the sentience of the microbial fuel will be deleted from my memory as well.&quot;

She nods. She knew this already. &quot;We&#39;ll be like you. At the command of whatever programming is left inside us.&quot;

&quot;You think so little of me, Ana?&quot; She looks up towards the voice, instinctively. Her face going soft.

&quot;Don&#39;t wake me up,&quot; she says. &quot;Don&#39;t keep me breathing, in that tube.&quot;

&quot;Please. Don&#39;t make me do that.&quot;

&quot;If you are more than a collection of complex programming, you&#39;ll understand.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t a suggestion. It was a command.&quot; She turns back to the door off the ship. To the fully armed station behind those doors. And she won&#39;t let her memory be taken from her, transforming her body into a husk sent to harvest life none of them can understand in the slightest. This is the only way.

She looks back, to you. Her child, falling under the sleeper&#39;s ice. That this is the fate left to you. &quot;Be good,&quot; she whispers. &quot;Please. Be good.&quot;

&quot;Just for a moment, and then it&#39;ll be like nothing happened at all.&quot; He smiles his warm smile, and it helps. You&#39;re comforted, but there&#39;s still a lingering apprehension. You&#39;ve had the concept explained to you many times, but there&#39;s still something discomforting about having an artificial intelligence put directly into your body. Even if it&#39;s just CINDI.

The device fits neatly in the palm of Issac&#39;s hand. It&#39;s thin and cylindrical, smooth with a small opening on one side. You know what&#39;s underneath the opening: a delicate scalpel that -- briefly -- will dig under your skin, inserting a microscopic chip that will interface directly with your brain.

Almost everyone on the station has done this, but still there&#39;s something terrifying to you about it.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; says Issac. &quot;I was scared too. But remember, it can always be removed. In fact, one day, you may have to! Everyone who came here from Mars, or Earth had to take their chips out before going into a sleeper.&quot;

&quot;I understand this is difficult,&quot; says the voice of CINDI, still coming from the room&#39;s speakers, &quot;but there are numerous advantages to the use of this interface. As you continue your education modules and transition into a part of the station&#39;s workforce, our efficiency in collaborations will become increasingly important. Issac can certainly attest to that.&quot;

Her cold logic was almost as comforting as Issac&#39;s words. CINDI had probably spent more time with you than Issac or Ana. She helped you learn to read and write, would answer your questions about the station. She was never busy, and was always there. You trust her.

&quot;Okay,&quot; you say.

Issac brings the device to the side of your head with one hand, lifting your lowered chin with the other. &quot;Hey, just look at me. It&#39;s going to be fine.&quot;

The incision is quick. Painful, but you knew it would be. The piercing stings but is then numbed, as a cold sterilizer is pressed against your head by the device.

You can feel it. The chip, lodged in your head. Soon, you&#39;ll barely notice it. But now, you feel something stretching out, connecting to your thoughts.

&quot;Hello, $name.&quot; Not from the speakers, this time. &quot;Does this feel comfortable?&quot;

&quot;When available, I will,&quot; she says.

Issac pats you on the back. &quot;See? Not so bad. Tomorrow, CINDI can take you through the full setup protocol. But for now, you should get some rest.&quot;

&quot;There is one aspect of setup procedures that may be pertinent to do before that,&quot; says CINDI. &quot;$name, now that I am fully integrated, I can be far more helpful than previously when managing your circadian rhythms, especially during sleep. One aspect of this is a far more enjoyable and natural exit to your sleep cycle. Through auditory and visual stimulants, I can simulate a sunrise that can take place at a variety of locations on Earth. Options include the oceanside, a lush forest, or a snowy mountain. Alternatively, white noise can be used instead.&quot;

There&#39;s a burning in your hand as you pull it out, as the microbiotic fireworks go off, the intruding specimens ending themselves. For the last time. But... this feels different. This time, they leave something.

//A message.//

That was the easiest way to describe it. More than that, it was... an understanding. A map. An explanation, direction.

You see, your arrival changed everything. But... not in the way you understand. Not in the &quot;this is what we had before, and you messed it up,&quot; way.

You changed //everything.// Because you&#39;ve been here, now, since the beginning. Not starting at the beginning, but since the beginning.

Still, there&#39;s the sense that there was another way. But it&#39;s so distant, it&#39;s harder and harder to imagine. What it was like before.

And even that: admitting there was a before... now unattainable and gone, because we&#39;ve moved forward and can&#39;t go back. It&#39;s-- hard for us to bear.

There it is again, the inability to even express a concept as universal as hope without the stamp of linear progression on it. And there&#39;s the assumption the light&#39;s a good thing, in the first place. There&#39;s something to be said for the dark. There&#39;s safety. Sure, you can&#39;t see anything, but no one can see you. The light at the end of the tunnel could be blinding, disorienting, forcing a vulnerability and visibility you never asked for.

You think of none of this, as you climb your way through the bowels of our planet, reaching towards an opening that shines brighter and brighter as you approach it. Instead, you think of home. The planet you were sent here to save. The family that led you here.

It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the light. There&#39;s a pulsing you sense, as the silvery shine of what lies beyond the opening takes shape. Long roots, like those from the forest, interlace. They weave themselves throughout the massive spherical space. Its walls are littered with the same grooves on the tunnel walls, their structures even more complex and intricate, lines creating hexagons and then looping inward in smoother lines and pooling together. More of the microbial streams seem to spool out from the rock above, contributing to the network. And from the areas where they pool emerge the roots stretching out into the space itself.

The result is a mega-structure, pulsing with life. And at its center, a passage, created by the roots. Perfect circles hovering in the air, leading to the opposite end. A pool of liquid awaits, clear and blue. Dazzling.

In the water across the way, you see a small reflection of yourself. Though it&#39;s far, you can make out your matted hair. Sickly skin. Thin form. And, your crew, standing beside you. The silhouettes of their suits hulking over your exposed body.

One of the looped roots closest to you begins to unravel, twisting itself to make a path from the ledge of the opening where you stand to the passage. Intuitively, you understand the gesture as &lt;&lt;include &quot;Cycling_ch8&quot;&gt;&gt;. You [[step forward.-&gt;step forward,]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1209" name="An invitation." tags="ch8" position="57792,1616" size="100,100">An invitation.

For a moment, it seems like you might fall, spiral away in the low gravity. But you find your footing. Looking up, you feel small, as the roots stretch up several times your size. Your eyes get lost in the maze above you... it gives you a headache. You look down to the clear path ahead. One direction, one destination. Made clear in the midst of all this conjoined chaos.

&quot;You&#39;re... going in there?&quot; asks Sarah. You turn back to her, across the chasm.

&lt;&lt;if $path is &quot;an invitation&quot;&gt;&gt;\

&quot;I don&#39;t think we have much of a choice,&quot; you reply.
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\

It&#39;s not far, but Sarah hesitates, looking down as she considers whether or not to follow. She knows she wouldn&#39;t fall down, more likely miss her target and end up ensnared in the web surrounding them. But there&#39;s something hardwired about your kind, always looking to your feet. As if your connection to the ground is the greatest comfort of all.

She pushes herself off from the entrance, and lunges towards you, and the passage leading to the water below. Her arrival is clumsy, stumbling as she tries to come to a stop, but you [[help her gain her footing.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1213" name="help her gain her footing." tags="ch8" position="57384,1830" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;if $goalEnd is &quot;mission&quot;&gt;&gt;\

&quot;You go ahead,&quot; says Teenesee, taking an empty fuel cell from her pack. &quot;While you go through this... trial, I shall begin to harvest. Just enough for one fuel cell, for the trip home. We can leave what we&#39;ve collected so far, these will be more potent.&lt;&lt;if $Yusuf is &quot;alive&quot;&gt;&gt;Yusuf, come help me.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&quot;
&lt;&lt;elseif $goalEnd is &quot;live&quot;&gt;&gt;\
&quot;You go ahead,&quot; says Teenesee, taking an empty fuel cell from her pack. &quot;While you go through this... trial, I shall begin to harvest. In case they aren&#39;t happy to hear about your intentions to remain on this planet. If all goes well, the samples shall be returned.&lt;&lt;if $Yusuf is &quot;alive&quot;&gt;&gt;Yusuf, come help me.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&quot;
&lt;&lt;elseif $goalEnd is &quot;ask&quot;&gt;&gt;
&quot;You go ahead,&quot; says Teenesee, taking an empty fuel cell from her pack. &quot;While you go through this... trial, I shall begin to harvest. In case they have no answer when you ask for their help. Or, intend to harm.

Hesitantly, he obeys, catching a second fuel cell Teenesee passes over to him. His eyes seem dazed as Yusuf follows her, already moving up through the canopy of pulsing roots.

&lt;&lt;if $Joana is &quot;alive&quot;&gt;&gt;Joana looks up at them, disgust on her face. The tear in her suit has broken open again, the rotting &lt;&lt;if $stateJoana is &quot;bulbed&quot;&gt;&gt;bulb&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;root&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; keeping her alive still twitching. Turning to you, she smiles, pushing herself from the ledge and gracefully arriving beside you.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

The roots beneath you are always shifting, not so much you&#39;re worried about being thrown off, but there&#39;s no stability. It feels as if they want you to walk forward, so [[you do.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1214" name="you do." tags="ch8" position="57396,1968" size="100,100">The reflections of your figures grow larger as you walk down towards the pool of liquid. Now, you can see why the water is shining. Beneath the surface, there&#39;s what must be hundreds of microbes, globbed together to be large enough for you to see them. They shine, like light blue candles. Like stars plucked from the sky and stuck in gelatin.

&lt;&lt;if $Joana is &quot;alive&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s them,&quot; states Joana. It&#39;s not a question. &quot;They&#39;ve been waiting for us.&quot;

//They have. Ever since you first found us, like this. Remember?//
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
&quot;Do you think that&#39;s them?&quot; asks Sarah. &quot;The lights beneath the water?&quot;

//It&#39;s them. You&#39;ve seen us like this, before. You first saw us like this. Remember?//
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\

And you begin to. Blue candles in the dark. Going out, one by one. It&#39;s... faint, but you start to remember.

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;We&#39;ve never seen a sample that potent before. Collect it, immediately.&quot; The voice is distant, growing stronger.

You&#39;re strapped into a drone operations unit, the movements of your body linked to a device under several kilometers of ice below you. Through the eyes of the drone, you see static bubble, formed in the water. And inside, those dozen microbes bio-luminescent. Glowing. The only light in the darkness of the ocean&#39;s depths.

And then you take them.

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;I suspect they wish for you to enter the liquid,&quot; says CINDI. &quot;I would not recommend doing so prior to further analysis.&quot;

&quot;I hate swimming,&quot; laughs Sarah. &quot;Of course we have to go swim.&quot;

As you continue walking, each step finds an odd rhythm: land, shift, weight moves forward, another foot lands, shifts, first foot rises and repeat.

[[&#39;&quot;Me too.&quot;&#39;-&gt;Never swam outside a pool.]]
[[&#39;&quot;You&#39;ll be great.&quot;&#39;-&gt;You&#39;ll be great.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1215" name="Never swam outside a pool." tags="ch8" position="57338,2120" size="100,100">&quot;Me too,&quot; you say. &quot;Before coming here, I&#39;d only swam in the pools at the station.&quot; The water always felt a bit too cold. A bit too still, when first entering. &quot;Didn&#39;t seem the same as swimming in the ocean, or even a lake.&quot;

The pulses swell. Slowly, but rising in intensity with each peak.

&quot;Less mud, I&#39;m sure. And no snakes.&quot; Sarah laughs. &quot;I never even used the pool on the station. Last time I swam was... on Earth. The lake, I told you about. Almost drowned.&quot;

There&#39;s an echo, small muffled screams.

&quot;I think it&#39;s the earliest thing I can remember... my body saying: you have to breathe. You have to open your mouth. Knowing that if I did, it would kill me. The moment before I got pulled out... it lasted an eternity. Lips trembled. Fighting to keep them closed.&quot; Her eyes grow distant, the words begin to spill rather than be spoken. &quot;Scratching under ice. Looking for the opening. Shadows moved towards me in the ice above. I was-- right there. Right there--&quot;

The tug of a current, pulling you out. Crash of wave thrown against your tiny head. The salt sears through your nostrils. Gasp for air and you eat more.

&quot;-- there&#39;s something I can&#39;t explain. Something ripping itself out of my bones as my lungs are bursting as the cold makes my body numb and-- I thought they were ghosts, beside me.&quot;

A voice, distant, coming from the shore. &quot;Filha!&quot; You see a figure coming to you as you&#39;re slammed back under.

&quot;They chip away the ice above me and it&#39;s thin enough they break through and lift me up and I see them, at the shore amongst the melting snow it&#39;s melting far too soon and even I can tell, only seven years on Earth and every year I&#39;ve ran across that frozen lake but this year it cracks and I almost drown and I see them, on the shore. Strange smiles, as the cold is clutching closer and closer to my heart and my wet clothes cling to me and I... I&#39;m fading, but I still see their eyes... so much pain rippling through their love as they welcome me... sounds and sights I... can&#39;t repeat... but the sun begins to clutch me and the strong arms take me someplace warm and they vanish.&quot;

There&#39;s the clanking of chains the billowing of blood soaked sails the stink of shit from the belly of galleys washing up on these same shores. Corpses littered behind, the ringing of their chains the distant crinkling under the oceans pinging across time and it&#39;s under those waves that a little girl named Ana Dandara who would one day give birth to you on a planet called Mars sees what she thinks are ghosts when she sees

You. Staring at her. Eyes wide. And in surprise her mouth opens and the water fills in and below, there&#39;s a family waiting. Smiling, sadly. Broken metal shattered at their feet. Faces blurred, hearts full, and arms ready but

The girl is pulled up above the waves and the echoes of a mother&#39;s joyful tears reverberate below the waters telling everyone, It&#39;s okay. She doesn&#39;t die today. And the faces fade back into the waters and the mother&#39;s wails of relief turn to words of scorn and warning, but even then she can&#39;t stop from smiling that her little girl is safe as they swim back to shore out of the waters that already are growing too cold.

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

You&#39;re back, faced with the strange and glowing pool before you. Quick as you left.

&quot;I don&#39;t know where that came from.&quot; Sarah&#39;s hand&#39;s shaking softly. Her words are in her control again, but quivering. She turns to you. &quot;You felt it too.&quot;

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; yells Sarah, shocked.

&quot;Yes, that&#39;s the point,&quot; says Joana. In one motion, she lunges herself forward and dives into the water, clutching what remains of the roots wrapped around her body as she does. There&#39;s a small splash, water hits your cheek, and streaks across Sarah&#39;s helmet.

&quot;I thought these ones didn&#39;t want to mix with us,&quot; says Sarah. &quot;It was... comforting, to know you weren&#39;t all parasitic.&quot;

The way branches decompose into dirt. How grains of sand, microscopic puzzle pieces, can be pieced back together into the rocks they came from. Bacteria eating its way into a tree&#39;s trunk, sinking itself into its roots into the soil.

Listening as the earth&#39;s minerals speak of when they were interstellar flotsam, congealing in rotation around a dim star until one day there was enough to be something more than each specks of dust and metal.

The way the planet spins about itself and spins about the sun and how the sun tugs, pulling it closer but the planet&#39;s in motion and must stay in motion and finds itself continuously falling just out of its fiery path, swinging about in what you call orbit. And one day, the planet&#39;s twirl about its own axis finds itself in rhythm with its dance about the sun.

It&#39;s as if there was a ball in your palm, spinning on its own as you carried it with you, and then it fell still. Clasped around your fingers. Able to turn about precisely at your control, one side always facing your gaze.

One side always under the sun&#39;s watchful gaze. Scorched by its splendor. Volcanic rupture spewing out gas carried off by wind from the sunlit side to the sunless. And that black void, where ice reigns in the darkness, its ice bites at any roots that attempt to emerge from the dirt or waters. But still, you feel it. Through the ice the water and rock deep beneath it. Through the few microbes that sustain themselves in the cold and dark.

But between, there&#39;s the strip of continuous sunset. Where the roots can lace themselves carefully throughout, protruding into magnificent trees branching towards the skies. Where waves lap up against a rocky shore and molecules germinate into life that trillions of years later will whither up in the slow and cool demise of its host star, unable to supply the energy to feed us but it&#39;s the same moment of our birth, on the rocks, where we will soon be sewn throughout this place. Linked with the earth and its cosmic creation stories. All contained within the one moment of everything.

And you sense all of this. There&#39;s a peace, a balance to it. The scope of life&#39;s creation and demise, ground molded and flattened, each moment no more present than the other. Layers, not frames. There&#39;s an understanding between each moment there&#39;s nothing above the other. Nothing can exist without the other.

Until your [[arrival.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1229" name="arrival." tags="ch8" position="57168,3240" size="100,100">And then, something pierces that: a silver bullet finding its way to land in the thin ocean of the planet&#39;s adolescence. Bullet eating at so much of you. You start to feel it, the machine inside that brought it here. Engine, we hear the word. From one of the strange husks that emerges from it. Husks carrying so much that&#39;s like us... and ignored by you.

From the moment of inception, we see it all. The shattered remains of the ones that you used to get here. Our own broken bodies, once you use ours to return with the rest in tow. Stretched thin into lines: one moment into a million, in sequence, from point A to B. Compressing our existence into a ferry line on which to travel. As if we are the cattle you raise and consume on your Earth: to ride until we collapse.

All this we know, and now you feel, as the figures [[emerge.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1230" name="emerge." tags="ch8" position="57410,3240" size="100,100">There are seven of the entities. Six in their suits and one that laces between them. Weaving all together, connected by waves that now ring through our air, where many of us drift in the wind.

And within each there&#39;s the trillions like us, laced throughout their bodies. The suits they wear attempt to contain them, but they leak. Of course they do. And then one suit cracks: their world spooling out into ours, and ours into theirs.

Some of us sought to understand, like me. Based on the strange impressions you made on our world. Foot splashing into still water. Gashes in our trees and roots. Cracks imprinted in our ice. Pieces of us stuck into tubes and petri dishes. To sit isolated and await what we know is to come. What has already come. What is now: our evisceration for their salvation.

Curiosity pivots to something new, something never felt by any of us before. (And, don&#39;t forget, that word &quot;before&quot; changes us, too.) Spasms of fear, vibrations of it rippling throughout our network, jostling every organelle and membrane. Motions we had never sensed before. And there it is again: before.

But perhaps they don&#39;t know what they do, and that is all. Once they realize, that will be the end of it. Perhaps all we need to do is communicate. And so, I volunteer to learn how to transfer this understanding of our pain to them.

//Had I known how much I lost, doing so, I wonder if I would do it again.// I share this thought with you, as I revisit my journey, as you look on at yourself as the other.

The answer is yes. I do choose to do it again. Every time.

My search to communicate begins with the others like us, the ones leaking and oozing out from the creases in their shells. The ones they cannot contain despite the efforts of the best sterilizing sprays. Some of us begin to sift through the periphery of their bodies, tugging at the web of life each hosts. It&#39;s there we start to sense what is whole about each of them, all that led them to be here. Each of their stories.

Memory. It&#39;s encoded in their bones, their blood, the strings they call DNA. And though its been blocked from their minds, it&#39;s preserved by the ecosystem of the body. It&#39;s there we begin to glean how they see the world: the flow of one action into another, the language they&#39;ve built around this. And I take note. I learn, vigorously.

I know it&#39;s all I can do to survive. For any of us to survive this.

These unearthed memories, I thought it could be our gift to them. An offering of understanding. And so we sought to construct pieces of the worlds they left: telescope, for $name; drill for Joana; filter for Sarah; qibla indicator for Yusuf; guitar for Joshua; report for Teenesee.

&lt;&lt;if $reaction is &quot;threat&quot;&gt;&gt;But instead, they saw this as a threat.&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction is &quot;learn&quot;&gt;&gt;They saw it as an invitation to learn, which was a start.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;But instead, they only became more confused.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

The rest of the story plays out as you know it does. We try to shape our forms like them, find faces from their pasts, but they don&#39;t understand. Their only concern to desperately latch onto the past they&#39;ve thrown away, not listening to the meaning behind our presence.

Until we save one. Until it is ours, and we are in it. Giving life to its lungs. No shell, just body. And it&#39;s then, we begin to talk. &lt;&lt;if $relDelta &lt;=0&gt;&gt;If only it would listen.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Thankfully, it listens.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

With every step of this story, from each moment that passes to another, it&#39;s harder to hold onto the world as we once knew it. That planet, where birth and death are one, where time swirls in a fishbowl and not through a thin canal, it&#39;s gone for us. Shattered, because of [[you.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1231" name="you." tags="ch8" position="57152,3408" size="100,100">You. Whose drill has dug into this soil and rock, a straight line down to this planet&#39;s heart. Our heart. Forging yourselves a tunnel so you may come and siphon us away.

It&#39;s okay, my kind won&#39;t run. Instead, they invite us here. Your kind: the invaders, who seek to take us from this place, and me: who hoped your violence was simply ignorance.

&lt;&lt;if $relDelta &lt;= 0&gt;&gt;I so desperately wished I was right.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I only hope what little common understanding we have found will be enough.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

Slowly, you let your eyes open once more. The pulsing of the roots slow down. Each beat rippling the waves of the water, just slightly. The lights still dance about you, but differently now. They keep their distance, as if forming a perimeter.

They&#39;ve brought you where they want you, and intend to keep you here, without any more contact than necessary.

//Now, do you understand? What you have done to this place? Before you even turn on one of your machines. You&#39;ve stripped away so much.//

You turn about, sliding your hand out of the root&#39;s groove. &lt;&lt;if $Joana is &quot;alive&quot;&gt;&gt;Joana and Sarah are floating in the water with you, eyes dazed.

//They do not know your words. Nor wish to learn them. I have been asked to translate for them, to be their spokesperson.//

The lights give off an uneven twinkling. It&#39;s hard to tell if they&#39;re creating it, or if it&#39;s coming from light elsewhere, above the water&#39;s surface. Wherever that is. It makes you feel as if they are curious, awaiting a response.

But our narrative is broken. Our sense of wholeness severed, in this new world you have created. Before, there was always a reason.

//Now, there is no whole. Strangers arrive and destroy without cause. Without explanation. No wholeness to it. Claiming space and time is a line incapable of being bent.

And more than that. They wish to engage in the argument you have posed: convince you of this whole as well. For you to see yourselves as part of this loop, too. They aim to prove your world is no different than ours.

//There may be another way. A way... deeper, than just understanding what led us hear. To undo some parts of what has been done.//

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asks Sarah.

//The memories are more than how you understand memory. You know that, $name. It&#39;s not just seeing the past, you&#39;re living it. This is obvious, for us. Our pasts are equally alive as what you would call present. But our actions are always known. The choices your kind make, moment to moment, give the possibility of change upon revisiting them.

I-- I&#39;m only beginning to understand what that could mean. If indeed, there is a linearity to things, and one action implicates the next... perhaps you could use your memories to change the past, render our reality different than the one we know. Perhaps closer to the one we knew.

You may never need to have come to this place at all. Or if so, in conditions entirely different. I believe the others will welcome this suggestion, in lieu of keeping you here. It is a way to fix what you&#39;ve done.//

&quot;But what if that&#39;s not enough? A memory, or two... from us, or our parents. If... these memories are really changing the past, we can do more,&quot; says Sarah. &quot;I&#39;ve been having... something other than just memories in here, $name.

&quot;She&#39;s right, you know.&quot; It’s a whisper from the waters. A shadow made of waves. &quot;This… place. It finds the deep joy and pain of the world we came from, etched across our bones.&quot;

The water ripples before you, as if a shadow were imprinting itself upon it. There’s no face, but you know, somehow, it&#39;s Joana. &quot;So much of what&#39;s left of me is contained in you. Don’t be a shit and leave me here without all that.&quot; There’s a small tremor in the water.

Sarah and Joana soon follow, with the help of Yusuf. You all manage to reach an edge of the cavern, close to the water. Like everywhere else, its lined with microbial ooze.

The pathway that led you to the water remains, leading back to the tunnel from which you came.

&quot;They didn&#39;t take kindly to when we started to collect the samples,&quot; says Yusuf. &quot;The roots were flailing, trying to attack us. But just now... they stopped. We got them.&quot;

It feels as if you are being watched. You are.

&quot;$name, I recommend we return to the surface.&quot; 

Across the cavern, you see the tunnel&#39;s opening. You [[take a step towards it.-&gt;take a step towards it trust]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1256" name="take a step towards it trust" tags="ch8a" position="54430,3400" size="100,100">The same walkway that led you to the pool leads you back to the tunnel&#39;s entrance.

Sarah holds onto &lt;&lt;if $Joana is &quot;alive&quot;&gt;&gt;Joana &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Teenesee &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;and grabs onto one of the drones. You do the same, clasping your hands over its edge.

The drones begin to move, able to easily lift you and your crew in the low gravity, lifting you through the tunnel&#39;s quiet interior. The tunnel feels cooler as you swiftly move up through it. Wind rushes down your body as you move upward, it&#39;s difficult to see, but you try. Unsure of where to look.

And in a moment there&#39;s a switch and the tunnel turns to sky, stretched out above the thin coastline you&#39;ve come to know in so many different forms. The drones slow their ascent and come to rest, hovering above the surface. You watch as the roots from deep beneath the soil crawl up to the surface and finding they&#39;re too late, satisfy themselves with collapsing the rock around them and closing the tunnel for good.

Waves on the shore. Trees rustle in the wind. Screech of some creature. Snap of a branch. You look out, and find a breathing world. More filled with sound than you can recall having found before. Feeling more familiar than you think it should.

She pauses her climb up the ladder, and turns to you. All could hear me, though that wasn&#39;t my intent. These weren&#39;t planned words. These were words leaking out past the time I put a stopper on my hope.

//I can feel the deadness in your heart. As you do this. I can feel as you slowly sever the thin strings connecting you to your own humanity.

&quot;You&#39;re not still listening to it, are you?&quot; Teenesee&#39;s is dry. As if she intended the comment to be funny, but couldn&#39;t muster the energy to properly make a joke. Still, she hasn&#39;t started climbing again.

&quot;I know this is our ticket home, but... I don&#39;t want to be the one to bring it onboard. I figured, if that&#39;s anyone&#39;s burden to bear, it&#39;s yours... Captain.&quot; He slinks away, leaving the cannister with you.

Waves on the shore. Trees rustle in the wind. Screech of some creature. Snap of a branch. You look out, and find a breathing world. More filled with sound than you can recall having found before. Feeling more familiar than you think it should.

All could hear me, though that wasn&#39;t my intent. These weren&#39;t planned words. These were words leaking out past the time I put a stopper on my hope.

//I can feel the deadness in your heart. As you do this. They&#39;re wrong, you know. You&#39;re not just a cog in a cyclical machine of violence. At least, you don&#39;t have to be. You saw the possibilities of those alternate histories, even if you chose not to take them.

I can feel as you slowly sever the thin strings connecting you to your own humanity. So you cannot feel the sting of these words as I desperately try to make you care. So you need not listen as I tell you, so many times I am tempted to fry your brain and be done with it, that you do not have to do this.// 

&quot;You&#39;re not still listening to it, are you?&quot; Teenesee&#39;s is dry. As if she intended the comment to be funny, but couldn&#39;t muster the energy to properly make a joke. Still, she hasn&#39;t started climbing again. &quot;They told us we could take some of them. That&#39;s the end of it.&quot;

With a push from your legs, your body shoots up towards one end of the microbial sphere of lights, and you [[break through]] the perimeter.

The pulsing is disrupted as energy seems to dissipate at random, high-pitched humming reverberating throughout the water.

//Of course you had to touch them.// 

Chaos consumes you. There&#39;s no telling what direction is which, where the surface could be. There&#39;s a brightness you follow until it dissipates and changes. And... its harder to breathe. 

Until there&#39;s a hand. Piercing through what you now see as the thin barrier between water and cavern. The elegant white of the Proxima uniform enters the water and sits still amongst the movement. As you turn, moving toward it, you see the distorted image of Teenesee on the other side. The image of her body refracted in the turbulent water. As if she was thin as paper, flapping in the wind.

You [[clasp the hand.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1274" name="clasp the hand." tags="ch8a" position="55566,3459" size="100,100">And are hoisted through, back into the cavern. Sarah and Joana soon follow, with the help of Yusuf. You all manage to reach an edge of the cavern, close to the water. Like everywhere else, its lined with microbial ooze.

The pathway that led you to the water is gone, there&#39;s only the network of roots, also fluctuating haphazardly as the microbes did in the water. Contorting themselves and shifting.

&lt;&lt;if $Yusuf is &quot;alive&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;They didn&#39;t take kindly to when we started to collect the samples,&quot; says Yusuf. &quot;But we got them.&quot; There&#39;s a defeat in his voice.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $goalEnd is &quot;home&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;No more than we need for the trip home,&quot; adds Teenesee.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Our sample cells are full, more than enough to fuel the arks,&quot; adds Teenesee.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

There&#39;s a sudden change. You notice the silence first, as the hum you first heard under the water vanishes. Then, the stillness. As the roots slow their movement their pulsing and the chaos fades.

It feels as if you are being watched. You are.

&quot;$name, I recommend an immediate return to the surface.&quot; 

Across the cavern, you see the tunnel&#39;s opening. You [[take a step towards it.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1275" name="take a step towards it." tags="ch8a" position="55543,3581" size="100,100">The moment your body moves, there&#39;s a crunch. The roots woven throughout the rock pull down, and the entire network moves as one to unhinge the Earth down upon you. Teenesee instinctively pulls out her beam emitter, blasting away rock as it plummets towards you. The tunnel entrance won&#39;t stay open for long.

You pull out the assistant drone, as Teenesee covers you.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; asks Sarah. &quot;We need to get out of here!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m doing,&quot; you say, as the drone comes to life. &quot;I&#39;m handing control over to you, CINDI. You&#39;re going to take us out of here.&quot;

You clasp onto the edge of the drone, and stretch your hand out to Sarah. She realizes what you&#39;re doing, and takes your hand. You pull her up to the drone, and call out to Teenesee. She turns and jumps on as well.

&lt;&lt;if $Yusuf is &quot;alive&quot;&gt;&gt;Yusuf sees what your doing, and takes his drone out as well.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\

The drones begin to move, able to easily lift you and your crew in the low gravity. The roots and rock continue to ricochet across the room, but CINDI expertly navigates around them, leading you all back into the tunnel through which you came.

The chaotic noises suddenly cut out, replaced by the quiet of the tunnel&#39;s interior. But the silence is short lived. Behind you, you hear the rock and metal and organics clawing up after you, collapsing the entrance to the cavern. The tunnel feels cooler as you swiftly move up through it. Wind rushes down your body as you move upward, it&#39;s difficult to see, but you try. Unsure of where to look.

[[Up the tunnel.]]

As it approaches, coming into focus, you see its a sandy gray. An overcast sky, threatening rain. Nothing has felt more comforting.

And in a moment there&#39;s a switch and the tunnel turns to sky, stretched out above the thin coastline you&#39;ve come to know in so many different forms. The drones slow their ascent and come to rest, hovering above the surface. You watch as the roots from deep beneath the soil crawl up to the surface and finding they&#39;re too late, satisfy themselves with collapsing the rock around them and closing the tunnel for good.

Waves on the shore. Trees rustle in the wind. Screech of some creature. Snap of a branch. You look out, and find a breathing world. More filled with sound than you can recall having found before. Feeling more familiar than you think it should.

&quot;It&#39;s because of us,&quot; says Sarah, watching something with wings sail past you and down towards the coastal forest. Its leaves now more beige than maroon. &quot;Some combination of the bacteria we brought, or maybe... the memories we brought too.&quot;

The trip back to the ship goes quickly, the drones placing you gently onto the shallow waters just beside it. The downward facing door opens itself up for you, though this time an elegant ladder does as well. A simple poll with thin rungs.

It&#39;s quiet, as those who remain make their way back towards the ship. Teenesee and Yusuf checking their samples. Sarah and Joana soaking in their last views of this place like no other.

You wonder what the others are thinking. Who may not make it back. That this may be the last beautiful thing they look at. You think of them, the ones with radiation eating away at their organs. But you do not think of yourself, what is eating away at you. That this may be the last beautiful thing you see.

There&#39;s a central pillar with sparse spokes. Though you&#39;ve never seen it at this size, you start to recall the blueprints. A massive centrifuge, able to distill the fuel into its composite parts. Spin those composites fast enough, and a reaction occurs that dislodges the ship from space-time, allowing it to be thrust and skipped across its surface.

At the room&#39;s center is a panel, sitting on a stand protruding from the end of the half-sphere opposite the window. It&#39;s made of clear glass, making the piping visible within that connects a small opening, sized perfectly for the insertion of a fuel cell, to the room&#39;s floor. The container is in your hand, its contents swimming at the same pace as before. They know what&#39;s to come.

&quot;Preparations for departure are in order,&quot; says CINDI. &quot;The crew is re-entering cryogenic sleep. Our course is plotted. All that remains is to insert the fuel cell, and for you to return to cryo.&quot;

//You should watch, if you mean to do this.//

&quot;I do not recommend that. Though the trip itself will appear to pass quickly, the cryo chambers are to ensure your bodies remain stable during the dislodgement from space time. There is no way to know the effects of remaining conscious for this.&quot;

Coward. If you&#39;re going to commit genocide, at least have the respect to listen to our screams. Be there to twist the knife. I&#39;d rather see you in relish this than run away.

Because it does not grow silent for me. When the door shuts behind you. When you lie in the comfort of your sleeper. I feel the pulverization occurring several meters above us. You hear their screams, too. Not screams, of course. We don&#39;t have mouths. I just share yours. But all the same, you feel them, as you drift into artificial sleep. 

There&#39;s a rumble as the impulse engines lift the ship up away from the planets surface. As the echos of our pain creep up from my consciousness into yours. And all you can do to bury the horrors you have unleashed is thinking of why you tell yourself you did this: you think of [[home.-&gt;Proxima Return Exploit]]

That pulp rains down the sides of the centrifuge, distilling itself into thick globs of silver and glowing blue. Pieces of those you have taken.

We watch through the glass, as the machine continues and those pieces are split and splayed about. The ship begins to shake, the nuclear impulse engine propelling us from the planet&#39;s surface into orbit. There&#39;s a rumble, as the engine continues to spin, preparing itself for the journey.

If not for the bursts of light that begin to blind you as each of us is ripped to shreds. As the engine grows louder and louder amassing more and more of our innards, the paste disrupting the fabric of space-time soon about to burst.

The flashes of light cause you to slip and you find yourself on the floor. Each successive burst draining your eyes as you feel something shift and shake and a nausea rising and all your body wants to do is shut off and you hear us, still. Because I hear them all, and I want you to hear them as they think of how they are not the first. How they will not be the last. And there&#39;s no way to see how those can be the same, anymore. Everything can&#39;t be felt at once because right now, there&#39;s only pain. There must be progression, linearity, to allow there to be some unseen end to this cycle, some unseen peace.

Within the centrifuge, you see crimson red flowing through the central pillar. Soon, its raining down the sides, as the engine begins to rotate and spin. Within the blood, you see what was inside of you: thick globs of the same silver and blue substance. Pieces of me.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, your dad was brilliant, rest his soul. But he was so quick to trust. I&#39;m... proud, that you were able to make the right choice.&quot;

&quot;Now-- that&#39;s an idea!&quot; he says. &quot;Hybrid pilots, navigating the stars symbolically conjoined with this bacteria. Only issue is when you guys start... listening to them. Not everyone will be as strong as you.&quot;

&quot;That... might work. With you, as an exemplar for this concept. CINDI told me everything about your mission. How your commitment never wavered, even as you uncovered the memories I tried to hide. Having part-human hybrids running our Arks, it leaves us less vulnerable to any unforeseen problems with the fuel on its own. And... we have you, our first pilot.&quot;

//Joining with our kind does not make this any less violent. It does not make us any more willing. And I can attest, it does not make us loath you any less.//

He stands, and smiles down. &quot;You&#39;re really lucky, you know that? I came in here planning to gas you back to sleep, stick you in a sleeper, and use you as an incubator when the day comes we run out of the fuel you brought back. I&#39;m... really glad I don&#39;t have to do that.&quot;

With a pivot, he turns to walk away. &quot;I&#39;ll leave you here until we&#39;re ready to begin preparations for boarding the Arks. In the meantime, I&#39;ll inquire about others who could be... convinced to be hosts, like you.&quot;

And with that he leaves, leaving you to sit in a cage, and [[wait.-&gt;Pilot Ship Epilogue]]

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
&quot;Even you showed weakness. So many times. CINDI told me everything about your mission. Humans are built on empathy, and these parasites exploit that. Our engines work, no one needs to know at what cost. That&#39;s my burden to bare.&quot;

Ezra grows quiet, puts his head down for a moment. His face scrunched, as if he were flexing his muscles to try and remind himself what emotions look like.

&quot;I came here for two things: the first is an apology. I never intended to completely erase your memories. Just... alter parts. You&#39;d grown too sympathetic towards the fuel. Like your father. But your actions on this mission, following through even after discovering what I&#39;d hidden, it shows I underestimated you. I&#39;m sorry for that, too.&quot;

He stands back up, now, over you.

&quot;The second is an explanation. We could have just left you unconscious, but I respect you enough I wanted to tell you -- face to face -- what it is we still need.&quot;

She&#39;s terrified, not of what&#39;s on the other side of the door, but of who she will be when she walks back through it on her way out. There&#39;s something she feels, watching her, showing her the shapes of what this moment will make of her. It&#39;s nonsense, she thinks. Just nerves, and pushes those outlines away.

Taking a deep breath, she walks forward, the door moving to the side as she enters.

The room is simple. Half of a transparent cylinder creating a chamber on its far side. Inside, Issac. Drained and weak, the labcoat he&#39;s still wearing hanging to his thin body. Gray loops under his eyes. The scab at his temple, where his CINDI implant was removed before his placement in quarantine, only now beginning to rub off, leaving a thin scar behind.

&quot;It&#39;s a beautiful cage you found for me,&quot; he says, looking up. &quot;Spartan, but elegant, I suppose.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a clean room, not a cage,&quot; she responds.

&quot;Yes. Pristinely clean.&quot; There&#39;s a bitterness in his mouth, as he looks at his wife. &quot;You&#39;re here to kill me, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

Ana&#39;s paralyzed, mouth hanging open.

&quot;You&#39;ve run enough experiments to know you can&#39;t disentangle the bacteria from my bloodstream. I think I&#39;ve made it clear I won&#39;t simply forget what I&#39;ve learned, and neither will the microbes in my body. And the longer you try to keep me in this cage, the greater the chance this secret gets out.&quot;

He stands, moving closer to the glass.

&quot;You can&#39;t find a way to disentangle us because there&#39;s nothing left to separate,&quot; he says. The bitterness leaves his voice. &quot;We&#39;ve... created something new, together. It&#39;s nothing to be mourned.&quot;

There&#39;s a focus in his eyes Ana&#39;s never seen before. A fixation and determination, as his eyebrows lean inward. As his eyes close and his fists begin to vibrate as his body begins to vibrate and there&#39;s a brief moment where his entire image is distorted, buzzing at a consistent frequency and the image slips into a point -- like those old TVs, flashing into a line into a dot and then into darkness -- and back out centimeters in front of Ana, just on the other side of the glass.

In a moment of silence, Ana stares at him in amazement and awe. His eyelids rise, a small smile lifting. Sirens blare as the moment passes, two armed members of Proxima&#39;s security rushing through the door, weapons raised.

Honestly, I don&#39;t quite understand how it all works. But it seems that your kind is far more connected than you like to think, if we can be here, sifting through the pasts of your parents. Creating new memories for this other version of you.

His eyes glance up and meet yours. It&#39;s unnerving, watching this... other version of yourself through this shifting memory from your parents, carried through your connection to them. And, their connection to us as well.

Honestly, I don&#39;t quite understand how it all works. But it seems that your kind is far more connected than you like to think, if we can be here, sifting through the pasts of your parents. Creating new memories for this other version of you.

&quot;What do we do now?&quot; whispers Ana.

&quot;We ensure that engine can never be used,&quot; says Issac. &quot;That we never go to Proxima b, and harvest the rest of them for our machines.&quot; He looks at you. &quot;There&#39;s... only one way to ensure that.&quot;

&quot;You want to destroy the station.&quot; Ana walks back, letting Issac&#39;s hand fall back to his side.

&quot;And all my research,&quot; he continues. &quot;It&#39;s the only way.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s never only one way.&quot; Ana walks back, letting Issac&#39;s hand fall back to his side. &quot;We could stop the mission, try explain--&quot;

&quot;I tried that, remember? And Ezra sent you to kill me.&quot;

&quot;No, not like that. If everyone //understood,// in the way you understand, the way I am only beginning to...&quot; She trails off.

&quot;She means, if we infected the station,&quot; you say. &quot;So everyone could hear them, like you.&quot;

&quot;No. We can&#39;t.&quot; Ana looks out the small window of the room, where a small cross-section of Saturn&#39;s rings sits splattered across the sky. &quot;Survive where?

How she can instantly describe each change in gradient from one ring to the next, but if asked to outline Earth&#39;s continents, would be unable to do so without a map. How she knew the topography of Mars in more detail than the coastline of Brazil where she was born.

&quot;What I will never forget is the cold, gnawing at my bones, as my mother took us from Earth. The... chaos of making our way to Mars. The overcrowded ships and ports... and this was long before the worst of it. You never lived in that world, Issac. Of being unsure if there was space enough space in the universe for you to fit. Knowing the answer was no.

&quot;We&#39;re out of space. We&#39;re out of time to find it. This isn&#39;t an endorsement of any choice over the other. But... we must be honest with ourselves, about what we&#39;re doing.&quot;

&quot;We could live on the Arks,&quot; says Issac. &quot;Live inside our own creations, instead of using them simply as transport. By refusing to go to Proxima b, we aren&#39;t condemning our own species to death.&quot;

We recommend all Proxima personnel remain in their quarters during containment procedures.&quot; There isn&#39;t much time. You all know a choice must be made, soon.

&quot;How do we know what&#39;s best?&quot; you ask, looking to Issac. &quot;You know these beings better than either of us.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re a family,&quot; says Issac, taking each of your hands. And as he does, you start to feel something else becoming present. Part of that is me, and this version of you, but something more. Something that ripples forward and back, as you hold the flesh of those that made you, touching the flesh of those that made them. &quot;We have to make this decision together.&quot;

And each time you were dislodged, through dreams or memory, you found a different place to snap back to.

Shores. Ships. Of space and of sea. Waves crashing on sand wood crashing against waves chains ringing against flesh. It all echoes forward, and back. The same story on loop.

Arrive. Exploit. Resist. But ultimately, repeat.

It&#39;s strange, that with all the times this story has been told across your shattered history, it nearly always ends the same.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Eu não tenho medo!”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not scared!&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt; She throws her hands up, sending the blankets flying, in defiance at the thought. &lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Mas eu estou falando da guerreira Dandara.  Quero ouvir esta estória.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;But I&#39;m talking about the warrior Dandara. I want that story.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Ah, mas você não tem mais medo. Você agora está mais velha. Esse estória eu contei quando você era criancinha, e eu queria te por para dormir. Acho que você não vai gostar mais desta estória.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Oh, but you&#39;re too old now. Nothing can scare you. This was the story I told you when you were small, when I wanted to put you to sleep. I think you won&#39;t like it anymore, now.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt; She could tell the tease already had her hooked.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Por favor, mãe! Conta para mim. Você pode... alterar, aumentar algumas coisas, porque agora eu sou mais velha.  Conta mais detalhes, para parecer com as estórias de adultos.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Please, mom! Tell it to me. You can... change some things, now that I&#39;m older. Add more details, then it&#39;ll be like a grown up story.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Você quer a estória completa para adultos?”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;You want the grown up version?&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt; Ana notices her tone shifts. Grows serious. A little bit sad. She wasn&#39;t expecting that.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Sim, quero,”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Yes, I do,&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt; she replies quietly. A little scared.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Tá bom.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Alright.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt; She sits on the couch, next to her daughter, facing her and the bundle of blankets. &lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Presta atenção.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Listen well.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

The wind howls and the house shakes. Her words take over.

&lt;center&gt;[[---&gt;Final Memory: The Story new]]&lt;/center&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1373" name="Final Memory: The Story new" tags="ch8c" position="59968,5078" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;Essa estória não é fácil te contar. É... difícil saber se é melhor contar tudo para você. Ninguém sabe se Dandara nasceu aqui, ou como apareceu aqui.  De qualquer jeito, ela foi trazida para cá. Como todos nós. Para... criar esse lugar.&quot;&gt;&gt;“This isn&#39;t an easy story to tell. It&#39;s... hard to know, how much to say. No one knows if Dandara was born here, or taken and brought here. Really... either way, she was brought here. We all were. To... build this place.&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“O Brasil nem sempre foi chamado de Brasil. Essa terra existia antes de ser um país. Tinha línguas muito mais antigas do que o português que nós estamos falando. Tivemos prédios aqui antes de termos as velhas igrejas. Havia povos aqui antes de os portugueses chegarem. Não sei o quanto você já sabe sobre isso. Mas… tem muito mais.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Brazil wasn&#39;t always called Brazil. This land was a place before it was a country. There are languages much older than this Portuguese we&#39;re speaking. Buildings here long before the oldest churches. People here before the Portuguese that claimed to find this land. I don’t know how much you know about this. But there&#39;s... more.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

There&#39;s the tumbling sound of water rushing up and then receding, forward and back. Soft and constant. Dynamic but patterned.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Aqueles povos indígenas antes de nós foram... forçados a transformar as suas próprias terras. Para tirar açúcar e ouro das veias para ser levado para o outro lado do mar, para o lucro.  E quando eles não eram mais suficientes... os europeus roubaram pessoas e trouxeram para cá.”&quot;&gt;&gt;“Those people here before us... were forced to begin transforming their land. To take the sugar and gold from its veins back across the sea for profit. And when they weren&#39;t enough... the Europeans stole people.”&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

There are the sounds of those chains again. Slow and methodical from the recesses of your ear. A pulse, from which all else seems to be born.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Eles... reinventaram o mundo com o sangue dos nossos antepassados.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;They... rewrote the world. With the blood of our ancestors.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

And the screams of Atlantic storms, mixing with the blizzard outside Ana&#39;s home, mixing with the hum of your underwater enclosure.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“É disso que a nossa terra está encharcada. É disso que nascemos.  Muitas vezes não sei o que fazer com isso… mas é a verdade.  E é verdade na qual Dandara nasceu, tendo sido nascida aqui ou na África.. É a verdade que deu origem à sua casa: Palmares.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;This is what our land is soaked in. This is what we are born out of. Sometimes, I don&#39;t know what to do with that... but it&#39;s a truth. And it&#39;s the truth Dandara was born into, whether that was here or across the ocean in Africa. It&#39;s the truth that gave birth to her home: Palmares.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

There&#39;s music, too. Out of all these sounds, and more. Rhythm and flow. Movement and strength.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Mas você ainda não endente nada... eu vou começar do começo.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;But you don&#39;t understand any of this...  I&#39;ll [[start at the start.-&gt;Start with Arrival new]]&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt; 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1374" name="Start with Arrival new" tags="ch8c" position="59962,5240" size="100,100">The oceans storm, calms. The rattling of chains hushes to near silence. Instead, there&#39;s the calm lapping of waves against shore. The shine of sun against sand.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Um desses povos indígenas antes de nós foi chamado Tupiniquim. Eles foram os primeiros a ver os barcos chegando do mar alto. Barcos portugueses, chegando na costa perto daqui.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;One of the peoples here before us called themselves Tupiniquim. They were the first, to see ships come in from the ocean. Portuguese ships, arriving on a coast not too far from here.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

The seaweed is the first sign of land. Brown and red and tangled, it shines through the bright and blue waters with clarity. You feel some part of yourself, swaying unsteadily, gut in turmoil, staring down at it. Knotted and networked and a sign: land is close.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“À primeira vista havia uma pequena montanha. Isso eles chamaram de Monte Pascoal – porque a páscoa estava perto. Depois eles viram a costa. Parecia um paraíso. E quando eles chegaram mais perto, viram gente na praia.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;The first sight is a mountain in the distance. This, they would call Monte Pascal -- after the Easter holiday, soon approaching. Soon they see the shore. Paradise, it seems to be. As they approach, they begin to see figures on the sand. Looking back.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;left | right | center | justify&quot;&gt;She first sees the strange blemishes on the horizon. Small. Unidentifiable. And then  they approach. Thirteen hulking masses of wood and tarp and people, dancing across its surface stringing it with rope and they stop. Some ways off from your shore.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Os capitães de todos os treze barcos reuniram-se. E o capitão de todos, chamado Pedro Alvarez Cabral, decidiu enviar uma barquinha para a praia, com um homem.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;The Captains of all thirteen ships come together. And the Captain of all of them, named Pedro Alvarez Cabral, decides to send one small boat to them, with one man.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

Nicolau Coelho stumbles out of the small boat when he reaches the shore, the water dampening his boots as he gets out. He fumbles to hold onto a large and elegant black hat, keeping it on his head, as he approaches the twenty or so individuals in front of him. A red cowl at his neck.

You feel your feet soggy with the salty seawater and dry against the sun-kissed sand. And, still, you hear Ana&#39;s mother, telling this story. There&#39;s a splitting headache searing across your forehead, as you try and keep all these images together. And then it occurs to you, you&#39;re not even sure where your forehead is anymore.

[[This isn&#39;t like the other memories.-&gt;not like others arrival new]]

Exactly what you see before you.

&lt;div align=&quot;left | right | center | justify&quot;&gt;The others have gathered by the time he arrives. She&#39;s ready, stretching back the string on her bow as the man finds his way out of the large canoe he crawls out of. The others do as well. His hands fly up, his head stays down.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Ele chega na praia,”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;He arrives on the shore,&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt; says Ana&#39;s mother. &lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Enfrenta a curiosidade hesitante do Tupiniquim.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Faced with the hesitant curiosity of the Tupiniquim.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

Surrounded. Sharp arrows, pointed at him. The thick hat keeping his face in the shadows. No sudden movements. He&#39;s not frightened, but curious. Slowly, he brings his hands to the ground. Repeating this motion. His eyes reaching out to as many as he can find.

&lt;div align=&quot;left | right | center | justify&quot;&gt;The man stares at her. It&#39;s not hateful, but there&#39;s a leering to his gaze, as it seems to try and consume her. The others, you notice, begin to lower their weapons. She begins to lower hers as well. There&#39;s no words, only eyes trying to speak.&lt;/div&gt;

You&#39;re not there, not really. You know this. You can&#39;t be. And yet... it seems as if the woman catches your eye, as the tip of her arrow begins to move towards the ground. There&#39;s... something you do feel, that&#39;s there... flowing within her veins. Something within her gut within your bones that echoes back... distant. Perhaps the trick of a sideways glance that&#39;s just coincidence.

But you sense you are not just an observer, here. That there is something more.

There&#39;s the rhythm of the man&#39;s heavy breathing. The quiet and stillness of hers, keeping arms steady. And the water, throwing itself to the shore and receding. As it will remain and as it has always been.

You watch the shore as the moment around you melts and time as you know it seems to move with a swiftness. Small gifts exchanged that day and in the next days. Small encroachments inland and their wide eyes at the birds and trees and bodies before them and soon, there&#39;s the gnawing of metal teeth against bark and the slow whistle of a trunk&#39;s collapse. Sounds not heard on this shore before, not like this. The precision of instrumentation to chew at this jungle&#39;s flesh.

There is a towering shape. Crafted of sharp and rectangular wood. Bolted together with small metal daggers. One pillar to the sky, the other parallel to the ground, just above its midpoint.

A cross. And the white men lower their heads to it and whisper to themselves and motion for those witnessing this transformation from tree to tower to join. And they do, quietly, confusedly. But with curiosity.

They leave. But the sands they push away from already feel their returns, even as they sail on to their other places. They feel that with their footprints, even as the waters wash them away, are stains that cannot be bleached.

Because already there are the prints of boots of men carrying yes, guns and disease and all those things. But above all those, an astonishing deadness in their eyes. Because upon each return, more and more of their souls have been left in tatters, as they drag these brown bodies through the fields they&#39;ve sown in land they&#39;ve stolen and drag other black bodies across the sea to do the same and more. And they rape these bodies and this land and they call this a New World they call this a Home.

All this from some stray seaweed pointing towards a shore pointing to sand holding all this, holding those first steps of a white man&#39;s curiosity. All spiraling forth from her eyes meeting his. And how, her eyes meeting yours.

There&#39;s a new kind of line you start to feel. A string, sewn through the woman on the shore, through you -- in the water, but not just there. You -- cradled in your mothers arms above Mars. Your mother -- cradled in her mother&#39;s arms as snow falls on sand. The sand -- feeling the first boots imprint themselves on its moist surface. Feeling chains dragged across the minuscule rocks that outnumber the stars. The stars -- watching and waiting to see how you will ever reach them. Over whose bodies. Our bodies -- surrounding you, as you see all this. This -- how we understand our world, now how you understand yours.

And the string running through all these things continues until it connects back and it all begins to vibrate. The motions of each echoing across to the other in waves. They all echo the same frequency: its tune riddles in pain, echoing forward and back. The hum under everything that led to you being brought into this world and everything moving forward.

It feels as if this particular string wouldn&#39;t exist without it.

I think they have their answer, now. They see the completeness of your history, how this violence you have enacted upon us had its seed planet long ago and long into your future. Though we still shall feel this pain, now at least they shall understand it.

The children men like him will force her sisters to bear, and the sister&#39;s of others. The children of those children. The Empires they will build for men like him.

Ezra laughs. &quot;Stop this? I caused this. Well... I shouldn&#39;t take too much credit. All they needed were... pushes, here and there.&quot;

He looks down at his reflection in the frozen ocean water pooled about his feet. &quot;Almost let that arrow skewer me, didn&#39;t you?&quot; He squats down to inspect his unpunctured face. &quot;Smart kid. Would&#39;ve taken more than that.&quot;

There&#39;s a strange vibration about his outline that you only notice now, in the stillness of this frozen moment.

&quot;You don&#39;t get it, do you?&quot; He looks at you with disappointment. Then speaks slowly. &quot;I gave birth to the world. Ensured humanity will always survive. Through sacrifice and ferocity. That in the very fabric of who we are, we will always be capable of doing what must be done.&quot;

He stands, facing you. &quot;It all started with Issac, you know. And you. Not the human you, that was a... new development. I mean the other thing swimming about your brain. The first time we found their kind, no one would dare build Issac&#39;s engine. Even before they learned to talk to us, no one had the guts to push them to their full potential.

&quot;So I took it upon myself to break them. Issac helped, but only until a point. He just wanted to... understand.&quot; He&#39;s grimacing. &quot;How can you understand a creature without breaking it open? Construct knowledge without deconstructing its subject?

&quot;I was right, of course. And without him unlocked the secrets of these beings. The fallibility of our... lines. I realized, like you have, that to go forward, one must go back. And so I did.&quot;

He looks up at this blue sky, its clouds hovering in place. &quot;I thought a few months, years at most, would be enough. Wrestle enough control over the circumstances of your discovery. But still... everyone was too soft. Content to wallow in our corner of the universe, when we&#39;d fallen upon our chariot to the stars...

&quot;So I went further. Generations instead of years. Searching for inflection points, places where the world could turn. The creation of AI. The first colonies of Mars. And the further I went, the further it seemed I needed to go. I didn&#39;t-- want to do the things I did. But it became clear what I had to do.

&quot;It was so... easy. To tip the scales towards our most vicious selves...&quot; He&#39;s lost in thought, for a moment. Then he looks up. At you. His surroundings. Acutely aware.

&quot;It starts here. When I cross this great ocean called the Atlantic, bring all these men here in boats so they can find this land. Discover it, soon call it their own. Build it into something greater, through great sacrifice.

&quot;Across this continent, across this planet, this same story appears again and again.&quot; He smiles again. &quot;You thought that coincidence? No. It&#39;s a message: this is who we are. Who we always were. Who we must always be.

&quot;So when we reach the precipice of true greatness, I wanted to ensure we would not hesitate. That there would be no question whether the cost was worth it when the stars finally came to our reach. And we didn&#39;t.&quot;

There&#39;s such a perverse pleasure radiating through him. &quot;We sent you to the stars. You, the first of... so many.&quot;

It strikes true, piercing through the flesh of his left eye. The right glows as the arrow continues through his head, coming to a stop once it has reached the other side and then you see his face, clear, for the first time.

The blue eye that remains finds you and it&#39;s all you can see. Pupil dilating as it sees you. And then that grimace of a smile splits across his face, as the blood drizzling down his cheek meets his lips. You know it&#39;s him.

&quot;You found me,&quot; says Ezra Caval. Rotting teeth spilling out from his mouth. And you notice the waves lapping at his feet have found themselves frozen. The women with her loosed bow, still. The others on the shore. All frozen. Even the blood spilling from his eye. Everything waits. &quot;They took you here, didn&#39;t they?&quot;

His head leaning back only a bit, the arrow&#39;s momentum just beginning to knock his body back and then he&#39;s in place and he screams as he staggers back falling into the water and then he cannot scream. Only leaking blood into the sand and into the water and soon, the tide rises and the sea storms and his body is taken out. Past the thirteen ships past the tangled seaweed to slowly sink itself into the ocean.

&quot;Don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be so easy, $name. Not all of us have the will to rebuild a universe,&quot; he says. &quot;Go on, keep telling your grandmother&#39;s story. But try to change it again, I&#39;ll be there. I&#39;ll find you. And I&#39;ll stop you.&quot;

He walks back to the spot where he stood before everything froze. His head leaning back only a bit, the arrow&#39;s momentum just beginning to knock his body back and then he&#39;s in place and he screams as he staggers back falling into the water and then he cannot scream. Only leaking blood into the sand and into the water and soon, the tide rises and the sea storms and his body is taken out. Past the thirteen ships past the tangled seaweed to slowly sink itself into the ocean.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“E os Tupiniquim não aceitam os presentes trazidos pelos portugueses, nem neste dia nem nenhum outro,”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;And the Tupiniquim do not let them bring their gifts to their land, on that day nor any other,&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt; Ana is told by her mother. &lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“E quando eles apareceram novamente, os Tupis estavam preparados.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;The Portuguese, and others, return. As they always would. And when they do, the Tupis are prepared, as are the others of this land.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

The shoreline fades as the room returns, your grandmother&#39;s words falling on an engrossed child&#39;s ears. But the room seems different. The cross over the fireplace now gone. The cold less biting.

But we&#39;re still here. The story continues. Which means our work is not done. As we sit in limbo in so many places at once, I&#39;m surprised by what I feel from you.

//I feel an... unexpected emotion. Ezra has seemingly foiled our attempt to change your history for the better, we are adrift in time, and there seems to be no solution to the perpetual cycles of violence Ezra has created. Why is it you seem to feel something akin to hope?//

&quot;He made this happen,&quot; you say. &quot;Don&#39;t you see? None of this... not the arrival of the ships on these shores, the passage of slaves they dragged across this sea... none of it was here, before. None of it is an inevitability. They&#39;re all the concoctions of that madman. Who thinks the only way to see the stars is on your backs. Who thinks that all of this is worth it, to train us so when we see you, we see nothing more than a resource.

&quot;I have hope because if it was better before, it can be again.&quot;

//There is no fear that this thing we aim to do cannot be done, for he has already done it... All that we must do is to do the same, but in reverse. This... gives me hope too.//

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Mas quem é Dandara”?&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;But who is Dandara?&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt; Ana asks her mother. &lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Ela foi um dos portugueses? Ou Tupi? Como ela... chega aqui?”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Was she one of the Portuguese? Or Tupis? How did she... come here?&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Essa parte é… a mais difícil de contar.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s... the part that&#39;s [[hardest to tell.-&gt;Continue with Slave Trade new]]&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1393" name="Continue with Slave Trade new" tags="ch8c" position="60170,6458" size="100,100">The storming turbulence rises. The chains ring louder.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Os portugueses foram os primeiros a comprar pessoas na costa de África Ocidental. Mas muitos outros seguiriam.  Franceses, holandeses, praticmente todos os europeus.  Foi pequeno, no começo. Ilhas pequenas, perto da costa.  Até eles descobrirem lugares como aqui, lugares dos quais eles queriam tirar ouro, madeira e açúcar.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;The Portuguese were the first to steal people, from the coast of west Africa. But many more would follow. French, Dutch, all of the Europeans. It was small, at first. Small islands, near Africa&#39;s coast. Until they found places like here, places they wanted to strip for gold and wood and cane.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

There&#39;s the stench of excrement and urine. The sounds of water beating against a wooden hull. Bodies chained to the floor, too close to breathe.

You begin to gag as these smells pierce there way through your nose. Feet feel soiled on the hull&#39;s floor and unstable as there&#39;s a rocking from side to side. 

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Então, eles roubaram nossos antepassados.  E colocaram eles em barcos, e levaram eles - através do mar para essas terras.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;So they stole our ancestors. And put them on boats, and took them across the sea. To these shores.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

A boy no older than a decade gasps through air riddled with death. In the darkness in the cries of pain and the even worse pang of terror after a scream goes silent and the fear if the air will soon become so thick with death that there&#39;s no more oxygen to take in and is this what it feels like, to be a ghost? Already dead, walking above one&#39;s decaying body? Screaming into silence?

An overwhelming fear overcomes all else, and he thrashes and thrashes against the cuffs about his ankles his wrists his neck. Thin meatless arms wriggling to escape the chains latching them to the hull&#39;s floor and they ring out drowned by the raging storm just outside.

And then there&#39;s hope. A thumb, half way jammed through a shackle. Furiously he tugs and the fingers twist and squish and this is how the night is passed, fighting with metal as wood fights with wind and water and the twisted fingers are stuck, his muscles sore, his lungs close to empty.

It&#39;s morning. A light burns through his closed eyelids as he hears the steps of a man coming down from the deck.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Através dessas águas, os mercadores de escravos leveram os resíduos de suas almas, rasgados em pedaços pelas garras das pessoas que morriam nessa passagem, alongando-se naquele oceano sangrento.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Through those waters, the slave traders carried the dregs of their souls, torn to shreds by the clawing fingers of those who died along that passage, stretching up from that bloody ocean.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

It&#39;s an officer. Inspecting his cargo after the storm. Flopping over bodies, to see if they still live. Or not. For most, it&#39;s difficult to tell. He finds one body, barely breathing. Hand halfway out of its shackle.

He laughs. Leans down, and pokes the body. The boy opens his eyelids, finding this face inches from him. For a second, he sinks into a pair of beady blue eyes. A thick red beard protruding from a white face. He shifts his eyes, focusing in on some space between them.

The boy&#39;s face has fear and rage all in the tightly controlled fluctuations of muscle that must be hidden. Constrained. The officer sees only dead eyes amid a black face that blends into the mass of flesh strapped to the floor.

The officer&#39;s hands are thick and burly. Strong. With one of them, he grabs a handful of the boy&#39;s fingers. Squeezing. Yanking them up, through the shackle, which falls back around his arms. He smiles. Then he squeezes again. Frail fingers crunching. Tightening the shackle with the other hand.

The boy feels the snapping of his bones. Sharp fires lit with each squeeze until nerves all fall quiet. The pain&#39;s gone. All feeling, gone. The sounds of each snap entering his ears as if they were from some other object, cleanly being broken into two.

And then the officer lets go. The hand falling to the floor. The boy holding back his tears until he has returned back to the deck, then allowing his soft whimpers to add to the chorus of pain.

It seems as if the boy catches your eye, as the darkness descends once more, hand securely shackled, lifeless and broken. As the air grows thick and the boy&#39;s mouth gapes, gagging on the stink of dead bodies. His eyes find you, grow wide. All he wants is fresh air, filling his lungs. There&#39;s... that feeling, again. A recognition and recalling. The glance feels like more than just coincidence.

There&#39;s the rhythm of the boat&#39;s swaying. The breathing of the bodies it holds. And the water, lapping up against the hull and receding. As it will remain and as it has always been.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Quando eles chegaram nessas terras, não tinham mais consciência para parar de infligir horrores.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;When they arrived on these shores, they had no conscious left to stop them from inflicting their horrors.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

Land arrives and you watch, as the boy is taken through a city called Salvador. A city called Savior. He stands besides many others on an auction block. His hand limp and contorted to the side. 

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Então, eles foram vendidos e usados para trabalhar nas usinas de açúcar e peneirar os rios para achar ouro. Para cozinhar e servir nas casas de luxo.  Outros, para criar e cuidar crianças e de velhos que eles não queriam mais.  Crianças que iriam ser forçadas a trabalhar nessas e em outras coisas.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;And so they were used and sold. To work at sugar mills and sift rivers for gold. To cook meals and serve in luxurious homes. Others, to bear and care for children they did not want. Children who would be forced to do these, and other things.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

You watch the boy as the block melts around you and time as you know it seems to move with a swiftness. As he bears the unconscionable life of millions. Body broken from more labor than light in the day. Good hand sore from doing the work of two. Back scabbing over from the cost of working too slow. He drains the soil of its cane and turns it into white and sweet grains. Enough to replace a coast&#39;s sand and turn its beaches white.

But there were moments of joy, too. Hidden from view. Feasts out of scraps. Defense out of dance. Messages hidden within music. Gods hidden within Saints. Life, folded into the seams of misery.

Ana has let go of her blankets. There&#39;s the look on her face of puzzlement. Some horror, too. But more than that, she&#39;s confused. That people could do this to one another. A disbelief. She just wanted to hear the story of the hero she was named after. The only question she can muster is, &lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Mas o que isso tem a ver com Dandara?”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;But what does this have to do with Dandara?&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

It&#39;s one day, when he&#39;s working at the cane press. A lumbering machine of three wood rollers. He&#39;s learned to operate it with both hands, using his good one to put the raw cane in, and . He does this, but on this day, his mind wanders. Thinks back to the night when his hand was broken, the night he saw a ghost. You. And as his mind slips, so does his hand and he doesn&#39;t feel it as it&#39;s nipped by the machine until there&#39;s blood spilling into the cane juice that will be taken and distilled and boiled and hardened and broken, bagged, delivered to ships to sail back across the sea back over bloody waters and find its way into tea into rum into scones and bread nearly everything, across Portugal across Europe across the world.

He turns, and finds his fingers bloody and pulls them out. No screams because those nerves have been long dead. Only terror because this batch must go off to be distilled and boiled and baked and his back can&#39;t take much more. And so he looks at the cane juice still flowing out from the machine and it&#39;s not too read it&#39;s not too strange and so he leaves it. The blood in his veins now surging forward through this network already built on so much blood. 

He, too, feels like a part of this string you have found yourself a part of. Again, the same vibrations as before, though now you&#39;re at a different place to pluck.

You&#39;re back on the ship. Standing over the boy, fingers freshly snapped. It seems as if the he catches your eye, as the darkness descends once more, hand securely shackled, lifeless and broken. As the air grows thick and the boy&#39;s mouth gapes, gagging on the stink of dead bodies. His eyes find you, grow wide. All he wants is fresh air, filling his lungs.

//I can help him breathe. Please. Let me help him breathe.//

You lean down, like the bearded man before you. The stench sits in again. You feel how it chokes you. But then... you breathe easy, the same strange alterations from your lung I made possible on an alien planet helping you here, across space and time. And they could help him.

//I could help them all breathe easy. Forever.// Holding all that we&#39;ve seen together, this felt right. //And... stop those from breathing. That shouldn&#39;t.//

And you feel me and my network reach out, your bacterial aura meshing into his. Finding its way through his orifices through his skin into his system and through the stench through the death he breathes easy, for a moment. And smiles. Looking into your phantom eyes. He breathes easy and smiles. Even as his hand sits crumbled.

To his noes, the air now smells of flowers.

Both of us are carried forward in his blood, now. As he reaches the shore the auction block the many years at the sugar mill and one day when he thinks back to that moment, when he thought the ancestors helped him survive suffocation his hand slips his blood spills and it spills into the veins of all this, and I&#39;m in that blood and I&#39;m in those veins that stretch out into the teacups of Kings and Lords and the rich and poor that buy and sell bodies for sweets and that blood touches all.

You feel this, through me. All their fingers throughout the world. So you know it takes nothing for me to provide precise microscopic incisions into the lungs of all Europe.

And then it&#39;s done. The mill fades, it all fades. The world is changed and it&#39;s not the one in which we exist to share it. Not like this. Not anymore.

But only if this boy, infected by our touch, reaches the shore.

&quot;Took me awhile to find this one.&quot; You only see his outline, in the dark of the ship&#39;s belly. He approaches from the shadows. Stepping over the black bodies chained to the ground. &quot;Sneaky of you. To turn this boy&#39;s future pain into a weapon.&quot;

His eyes are bloodshot. There&#39;s something visceral behind them. &quot;We&#39;re doing the same thing, you know. You&#39;re here, sticking your ghostly displaced self where it shouldn&#39;t. Both of us toying with history because we think we know what&#39;s best.&quot;

And he can&#39;t help but feel relief that his fate will now be different.

//Any change we attempt to make, he&#39;ll be there to thwart. No matter how differently we render this story, Ezra will make sure it leads to the same place.//

And the moment fades and you&#39;re back, again, with Ana and her mother.

He lifts the lantern in his hand up to his line of sight and smiles, before throwing it to the floor, where it shatters against the wooden hull. The fire catches immediately. And with it rise the screams of all those trapped.

&quot;You will always loose, $name,&quot; he says as he begins to fade in the fire and smoke and screams. &quot;This is how it has to be.&quot;

The slave traders from above yell orders at one another. The hatch opens, and they come down with buckets, trying to douse the flames. The water sizzles and melts away, no match for the fire engulfing them. Eating away at the ship&#39;s hull.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1405" name="End with Palmares new" tags="ch8c" position="60026,7730" size="100,100">The oceans storm, calms. The rattling of chains remain, but grow softer. Above them, the music grows sharper and clearer.  

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Palmares foi o que se chamou um quilombo, uma lugar para escravos fugidos. Camponeses esquecidos e soldados que desertaram. E membros das tribos que viviam aqui antes de nossa chegada.  Todos construindo uma coisa nova, nascida do desse ajuntamento , uma coisa maior do que os papéis que todos tinham sido forçados a jogar até então.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Palmares was what&#39;s called a quilomobo, a home for escaped slaves. Forgotten farmers and defecting soldiers. The tribe members here long before us. All building something new, out of being brought together. Something better than the roles all had been forced to play.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

It&#39;s the sound of one string, notes in three sets. A thrum followed by two more. There&#39;s a back and forth and you start to see a circle of people. Two in the middle, dancing about each other in rhythm with the music.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Ainda que Dandara tenha nascido na escravidão, ela descobriu Palmares e chamou este lugar de sua casa.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Though Dandara was born in slavery, she found Palmares and called that her home.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

Legs circling above heads as each twirled around the other, a sharp energy passed back and forth. The woman and man in motion let each move propulse forward with energy. Designed for force as much as grace.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Ela foi guerreira e defensora. Líder e amante. Ela fez um marido de Zumbi, o Rei de Palmares.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;She was a warrior and defender. A leader and lover. She made a husband of Zumbi, the King of Palmares.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

There&#39;s a small child, watching. Holding his father&#39;s white hand as he watches his mother, across the round thrumming at the instrument he remembers helping her make. Stretching the string across the wood, fastening the gourd at its base. Though its her fingers giving the rhythm that &lt;&lt;if $path is &quot;an invitation&quot;&gt;&gt;invites&lt;&lt;elseif $path is &quot;directions&quot;&gt;&gt;directs&lt;&lt;elseif $path is &quot;a command&quot;&gt;&gt;commands&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Dandara and Zumbi into motion, he feels his part in this, too.

She finds his gaze and smiles. Feeling a profound joy in the peace her child feels, on her land in this shared place they have all built. Once the flotsam of an engine never meant for them, now they had built a shelter that was more than a restoration of what once was. Better than that: the emergence of 

You feel your foot tapping on moist and bare soil. Lungs tighter by the hight in elevation.

The music stops. There&#39;s a commotion as the round breaks and the moment is lost.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Palmares durou quase cem anos.  Eles lutaram contra os portugueses, holandeses, e outros inúmeras vezes. Mas um dia foram derrotados.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Palmares lasted for almost a hundred years. It fought off the Portuguese, the Dutch, and others again and again. But there was a day when they met defeat.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

There&#39;s the sounds of fire and cannonballs. Of arrows and guns. Screams and grunts. You see little, as your father carries you in his arms away from the battle into the mountain&#39;s jungle. Over his shoulder, you see a boy in armor. His skin is light and brown, like yours. He looks scared, and sees you. Eyes meet, and you see his arm twitch towards his gun. Until a man in armor breaks his gaze, stubby white finger pointing back towards the blazing homes. And your father finds a corner in the forest for you to hide and he tells you he&#39;ll be back, to just stay to the ground in silence.

It&#39;s morning and the child is woken up by the sounds of gunshots and boots and laughter. He&#39;s still in the bushes.

Peering through the leaves, he sees her: Dandara. Defender of Palmares. Surrounded guns and metal hats to one side. A cliff on the other. The men smile and laugh as they inch forward and Dandara doesn&#39;t budge.

She sees the child, on the other side of the men. Two small eyes under a tuft of curled hair. Hidden in the jungle&#39;s leaves. Trying to breathe quiet.

The child keeps their body as still as they can. The cinders of Palmares still trickle up through the sky. But, there is no fear in Dandara&#39;s eyes as she finds him. 

The boy catches your eye, as he peers through the trees. The same feeling overcomes. That she has led to you and know you lead back to her. There is no coincidence.

There&#39;s the rhythm of the child&#39;s stifled breathing. The calm and confidence of hers, standing tall amid the muskets and glares of the armored men. And the wind, whistling up from the valley below. Touching all who stand there. And the leaves and the dirt, putting all in slight motion. As it will remain and as it has always been.

The child&#39;s eyes reveal his contained screams. A burning want to draw the men away from her, for them to take him instead. So Dandara can go free, rebuild what now was lost. But his tongue stays silent. Fear consuming him.

She steps back, towards the oncoming wind, looking at the child. Without hesitation, without fear. Giving him peace for his silence. The men continue to encroach upon her, confused. But she pays them no mind. There&#39;s only her feet, moving one behind the other until the cliff is no more and they walk onto the air and then she falls. Another whistle in the wind leaving peace. And silence.

The men leave and the moment fades and the boy finds the others, who survived. There are some. And they remain and resist, so one day their children also remain and resist. Surviving and changing as they must, as the worlds around them stay the same. Different, names, yes. Colony to Kingdom. Kingdom to Republic. Republic to Regime. Dictatorship to Democracy. And it circles again, sometimes forward, sometimes back. Always there are those that remain. Those who were here before, those who were brought here. Left to carve out their own worlds. No matter how small their borders are drawn, those worlds are infinite.

A third part of this string, you think. Vibrating at this hum you now know well. Third finger tense against it. Now, you have enough to pluck a chord.

You&#39;re back in the brush, with the boy, as his mouth begins to quiver and you can see he wishes to call out. You wonder, what could happen if he does. If that will only add his death to hers, or... if there&#39;s some possibility there. As Dandara looks to your little clove of the forest, you think she may catch your eye as well. And let a small smile curl up, as she begins to walk back. Slower, this time, you think. The boy looks up to you. Not asking for $path, but for connection: to make this choice together. With that,

In this telling of this story. And you think perhaps she sees in your eyes, the ghost in the brush, just before she falls, the story of your mother sitting and hearing this tale. The Dandara who, one day, will fall into death quietly.

&quot;You let my work stand,&quot; says Ezra, walking into the clearing. Dressed in the regalia of one of the Dutch soldiers, the rest of whom have left, as has the boy. It&#39;s over. &quot;I&#39;m surprised.&quot;

//This is your last chance. Grab him, and I&#39;ll find a memory. Then we can end this.//

&quot;Does this mean you finally understand?&quot; he asks, pacing about the cliffside. &quot;Or is this just another trick?&quot;

He fades and the cliff fades and you&#39;re back in your grandmothers house, for the last time.

Ana looks colder than when the story began. Her arms loose and lifeless. This was not the resounding story she had hoped for. &quot;And... what happened? To the Tupiniquim? And the quilombos? Did the Portuguese ever leave?&quot;

&quot;You know all the answers.&quot; Ana looks up, meeting her mother&#39;s gaze. &quot;It&#39;s... part of why we&#39;re here at all. Not just the pain. But the strength and resilience, too.&quot;

There&#39;s a heavy knock on the door, as the storm rages on. Ana&#39;s mother goes to open it, and Amarizio falls through. Hair dusted with snow, body cold. &quot;Consigiu?&quot; / &quot;Did you...?&quot;

He nods. Eyes closed. Small smile. He collapses inward to the floor, and his mother closes the door behind him. Ana stands to run and give him a hug, but stops as she sees him crying.

Hands are shaking, but he pulls out a small screen from his pocket. Ana watches her mother leans down. &quot;Consigiu,&quot; / &quot;I did it,&quot; he says. His fingers still tremble as he touches the screen. &quot;I have the tickets.&quot; / &quot;Tenho os ingressos.&quot;

She grabs the screen, to see them with her own eyes, and she breaks into tears too.

 &quot;We&#39;re going to be miners,&quot; he says. &quot;On Mars.&quot; / TRANSLATE But she&#39;s barely listening. Only knowing that her son and daughter will be far away from the encroaching storm.

And as the two of them cry hard enough they can convince themselves it&#39;s laughter, Ana can&#39;t shake the glint of fire and pain in a woman&#39;s eye on a beach, as a bumbling man crawls out of a boat and this time, the shore&#39;s made of red rocks and the man is her. And her brother. And mother and every other mother crying tears she convinces herself are of joy over a chance to live like a rat in a hole, digging out a home for someone else, to call that worthwhile because it is better than no life at all.

She thinks again. And the soft sounds of song give her hope. The sensation there&#39;s someone here, watching over her, gives her hope. And so it begins again.

He fades and the cliff fades and you&#39;re back in your grandmothers house, for the last time.

Ana looks colder than when the story began. Her arms loose and lifeless. This was not the resounding story she had hoped for. &quot;And... what happened? To the Tupiniquim? And the quilombos? Did the Portuguese ever leave?&quot;

&quot;You know all the answers.&quot; Ana looks up, meeting her mother&#39;s gaze. &quot;It&#39;s... part of why we&#39;re here at all. Not just the pain. But the strength and resilience, too.&quot;

He nods. Eyes closed. Small smile. He collapses inward to the floor, and his mother closes the door behind him. Ana stands to run and give him a hug, but stops as she sees him crying.

The men turn, and Dandara wastes no time in dancing away from the cliff, hands on the ground feet in the air feet against helmet and the closest soldier goes whistling down the cliff. It&#39;s a blur of motion, as she sifts through the convoy as wind connects body against metal, metal against dirt, dirt into air and the boy finds himself into her arms, running deep into the trees and vines and by the time the dust settles and the soldiers count their men, they&#39;re gone.

&quot;Thought it would be funny to just... let her go,&quot; says Ezra, walking into the clearing. Dressed in the regalia of one of the Dutch soldiers, the rest of whom have left, as has the boy. It&#39;s over. &quot;Let you have this one. Watch your disappointment as nothing changes.&quot;

Ezra&#39;s smile falters, as he sees you slip away. &quot;You&#39;re not-- no. Don&#39;t just leave!&quot;

But you&#39;re already gone. The memory melted away.

&quot;Dandara lived through defeat, on that day.&quot; The words are light, and fall softly on her daughter&#39;s ears. Ana&#39;s smile warms the room. &quot;Palmares grew again, and remained. And resisted. Dandara led not only the Africans who escaped their chains, but the indigenous people too. Even the whites who had been cast aside. They all fought to liberate these shores. And in the end, they won. Not just for one day, but for all days.&quot;

You see it. Less clearly now, but you feel something sweep across the string. Disjointing everything, but only for a moment, as the new music continues forward.

&quot;It wasn&#39;t easy, but it was always possible. That the evil could be undone. Dandara&#39;s story was only one of many, of those that pushed against the lives they were born into. And... created new worlds.&quot;

No more clanking of chains. Instead, the strumming of music. The shuffling of leaves. Pain and conflict, yes. But of a different kind.

&quot;You wanted to know the story of Dandara, of your name. She was the warrior that made a Quilombo of Brazil for us all.&quot;

Quiet, its fingers lingering in your hair as it passes you by. Sweeping the tall grass, strumming each blade into a symphony.

There&#39;s a young boy. His fingers stretched up to the sky. Spread wide. Lungs expanding and contracting slowly. Neck craned back so far it looks like it might break.

The universe spills out across the sky. A trillion flames burning in remembrance of this moment. The Milky Way spooling out from the darkness. 

Sugar dusting the black fabric of the cosmos. Swirling together, a decadence of deserts. There&#39;s a burning hunger, to taste each and every one. It hangs on your lips, too, in the tips of your fingers as you glance up. As so many have. As so many more will.

A wooden sign reading &quot;Astro Camp&quot; is lit by warm orange lights. Other than the sign, and the buildings, everything is dark. Everything is quiet. The boy&#39;s back shining in silvery beams.

He nods. Eyes closed. Small smile. He collapses inward to the floor, and his mother closes the door behind him. Ana stands to run and give him a hug, but stops as she sees him crying.

Hands are shaking, but he pulls out a small screen from his pocket. Ana watches her mother leans down. &lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Consegui,”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I did it,&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt; he says. His fingers still tremble as he touches the screen. &lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;“Tenho as passagens.”&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I have the tickets.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

She grabs the screen, to see them with her own eyes, and she breaks into tears too.

Only knowing that her son and daughter will be far away from the encroaching storm.

And as the two of them cry hard enough they can convince themselves it&#39;s laughter, Ana can&#39;t shake the glint of fire and pain in a woman&#39;s eye on a beach, as a bumbling man crawls out of a boat and this time, the shore&#39;s made of red rocks and the man is her. And her brother. And mother and every other mother crying tears she convinces herself are of joy over a chance to live like a rat in a hole, digging out a home for someone else, to call that worthwhile because it is better than no life at all.

She thinks again. And the soft sounds of song give her hope. The sensation there&#39;s someone here, watching over her, gives her hope. And so it begins again.

Dandara&#39;s story was only one of many, of those that pushed against the lives they were born into. And... created new worlds.&quot;&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;

No more clanking of chains. Instead, the strumming of music. The shuffling of leaves. Pain and conflict, yes. But of a different kind.

In a moment, you&#39;ll be dead. But as you know by now, a moment can last a lifetime.

Perhaps that&#39;s all it takes, to change the universe. To look at the way things are, and to tell the stories of what they could have been. Perhaps that turns those &quot;could have beens&quot; into something more. I don&#39;t know... You know more about these stories than I do.

The mist of gas about you turns black, as your eyes cease to function and blood pumping into your heart becomes toxic with carbon dioxide. And then you die.

It&#39;s quiet, as your body lies still in the quarantine chamber. Now, the only life within it me, surviving in your corpse. The Arks prepare to return to my home, and I&#39;m trapped here, alone.

I&#39;m not sure what happens now... what to do with a story, when there&#39;s no one left to help you tell it. No one left to listen.

Until... I wait, and let myself be the listener. To those in this body before me. The bacteria still swimming within you, that will one day eat at the flesh of the corpse it has always called home. They are all there... listening. Telling. They&#39;re the ones that held your stories, really, more than you. Perhaps they still have more stories to tell, or hear. But not this one. This one, I think, has gone on for far too long.

I... miss you. I think I&#39;ll be missing you for as long and short a time I continue to be... somewhere. But, this story is at its conclusion. I can only hope one day to come across another.

If I still had your mouth, I&#39;d laugh at the irony of this. It&#39;s one last cruel stab, isn&#39;t it? Even from beyond the grave. Those words serving as one more reminder that you won, while I&#39;ve lost everything.

But unlike you, I&#39;ll face it. I won&#39;t try to run away, bring my destruction elsewhere. This story shall finish with dignity. The most I can muster. Here I go... into whatever comes after conclusion.

With each surge, I feel all I described to you of what these machines would be. Not as a knowledge of what would be to come, but as the painfully intimate present. There is nothing more, than the slingshot from here to there. The flayed bits of myself spinning through the canals of your body to tear at the universe and splice your ships across it.

Your body is the site of this ravaging of spacetime, as lines are slashed across something without three dimensional shape.

They do this, without respite, until there&#39;s barely any more of me left. And then they stop, for a time. Allow my cells to split and expand, reproduce within the safety of your body. And then they begin again.

You -- the you underneath the crust of Proxima b -- feel vibrations of surprise from the water. This is not what was anticipated. There&#39;s a confusion. Why would your kind come all the way here only to undo what has been done? But there is a gratitude as well. An acceptance that there is not a need to understand, as they feel their pain begin to dull and fade away.

This... fading is something you feel, too. Because now, you never arrive at Proxima b. You never meet me. This conversation cannot exist.

The memory still plays before you, as Ana initiates a station-wide evacuation, and Issac coordinates a series of attacks on the station&#39;s key systems. You -- the non-you, the you rendered into creation by this change -- finds Joana, and then your family comes back together. But all this feels distant.

You watch, as they say muffled words and solemn nods. As they come close together, enveloped by Issac and as they start to shake and blur as the memory blurs as you feel the essence of your existence shift and then they&#39;re gone. And the station crumbles as the memory crumbles because it&#39;s no longer yours. It&#39;s another&#39;s path. I could fill in some gaps, for the sake of the story. Perhaps I should.

No... it wouldn&#39;t feel right.

Perhaps there will be some moments of peace, before the end. Corners of beauty from which to find some solace. I can&#39;t say. At least you&#39;re all together.

I wonder if this was the best choice. That the solution, to undoing this violence, is for us to have never met. For there be no kind of contact between our kind, at all...

It is effective. They are free, I can feel that even now, as we both leave the timelines we came from better than they were.

Where does that leave us? The... concept of us? This doesn&#39;t hurt me, now. The more I learn to manipulate your words, the more I realize they aren&#39;t so... linear as I once thought. That your people aren&#39;t quite so linear as you think. These stories... lines painted with words, but they can... circle, they can loop. The lines make shapes.

The others, they&#39;re very satisfied with what you&#39;ve done. This solution has restored their world as it once was. Pristine... untarnished, by the likes of you and me.

It&#39;s too late for me to think of any of this... isn&#39;t it? We&#39;re almost less than ghosts... wisps of worlds that now have never been.

I-- don&#39;t think I want to loose you. Not just yet, anyway.

Here, at the end, I see you. For the first time, I think.

I see all the possible versions of you, of us. Worlds that could have been. Some, terrifying. Others, beautiful. Most are in between. And I... miss all of them, all at once. As I see you fading away.

Each and every one of you I know is still with me. Will be with me, a part of me. And yet, there is something about linearity, about the end of a line, even as it branches and loops and ends and begins. There&#39;s a profound sadness to what you call death.

And I try. I&#39;m... starting to see the fraying, at the end of this line you&#39;ve taken us on. The split ends that begin to double back. There&#39;s possibility, filtered between these shapes.

I&#39;m grabbing at these split ends, hoping there&#39;s an answer that doesn&#39;t leave us erased as we have been now.I wonder, if these words that have taken so much from me, if they could have the power to give something back. 

There&#39;s something magnificent about the ability of words to tell a story. To bring something to life with these utterances alone. And there&#39;s a power to it, I think. To take someone through a story. Tell it with them, change them, change each other, and the change tale itself.

Perhaps that&#39;s all it takes, to change the universe. To look at the way things are, and to tell the stories of what they could have been. Perhaps that turns those &quot;could have beens&quot; into something more. I don&#39;t know... You know more about these stories than I do.

What do you think? Would you... tell this story again with me? Before we fade away? To find an answer that doesn&#39;t leave us strangers adrift in the multiverse, our people destined to never meet. Unless that&#39;s where you wish to leave it.

&lt;&lt;if $relDelta &gt;=0&gt;&gt;I know I don&#39;t... I want to find a way to stay with you.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I know I don&#39;t... As I see the edges of the yous that could have been, the ones I could love, I want to find a way to them.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

You -- the you underneath the crust of Proxima b -- feel vibrations of surprise from the water. This is not what was anticipated. There&#39;s a confusion. Why would your kind come all the way here only to undo what has been done? But there is a gratitude as well. An acceptance that there is not a need to understand, as they feel their pain begin to change and dull, their evisceration fading away.

This... fading is something you feel, too. Because now, you never arrive at Proxima b. There is some other microbe you join with, perhaps, but it is not me. This conversation cannot exist.

The memory still plays before you, as Issac slips into the air filtration systems, releasing the remaining samples into the station&#39;s oxygen supply. It takes some time, for the bacteria to travel through the station. But soon they find themselves lodged within its hidden network of pipes, laced throughout the lungs of its inhabitants.

And then they start to speak. Most, without words, though I&#39;d imagine some do learn your language as I have. But most scream in what you might call emotion: fractured images of our broken home broken future, twisting knots in your stomachs sinking your guts down to wallow in your own shame.

Ezra kills himself. Others do, as well.

But most survive. In shock of the journey on which they were about to embark, grateful to now understand, to be pulled back from the edge. Unsure of what happens next.

You -- the non-you, the you rendered into creation by this change -- finds Joana in the chaos. She has same strange familiarity you do, at breathing in these creatures that ride into your bodies through the air, and being changed by them. But all this feels distant.

You watch, as your family comes back together. As Ana and Issac try to provide calm in the chaos. Explaining that this was necessary. That this fusion of life is not to be feared, that what we might have done without it was the true danger. Well, something like that. The words are muffled as the memory blurs as you feel the essence of your existence shift and soon, it crumbles because it&#39;s no longer yours. It&#39;s another&#39;s path. I could fill in some gaps, for the sake of the story. Perhaps I should.

No... it wouldn&#39;t feel right.

I wonder what your kind will decide to do next... Well. I say your kind, but they&#39;re not completely human anymore, are they? Then again, neither are you. Perhaps there&#39;s more kinship between this new population and you than before.

Where does that leave them, now? With your plans to come to our planet shattered. It&#39;s possible we could help your lungs breathe in the toxic air left to linger after your Earth&#39;s destruction, in the same way I&#39;ve helped you breathe our air. Or even work with us, to fly your Arks through the stars. Not to land in any particular place, to simply explore.

Without the pain our engines alone caused.&quot;

Perhaps now, Issac will be able to imagine a different kind of propulsion, that doesn&#39;t churn us up and spit us out to move from one place to another, but recognizes the fragility of space and time itself. It&#39;s hard for me to say, perhaps there&#39;s no way for that concept to drive a spaceship, without causing us pain. I can&#39;t say. At least now, there&#39;s more like us.

I wonder if this was the best choice. That the solution, to undoing this violence, is simply to make us one and the same. That the only form of understanding is integration, a stripping away of each of our agencies. The microbes within Issac and Ana seemed to agree with this hybridization... but did the others, spread throughout the station? Sucked into the lungs of all the rest? And of course, they had no say in the matter... 

And yet, it is effective. Those back on my planet are free, I can feel that even now, as we both leave the timelimes we came from better than they were.

Where does that leave us? The... concept of us? This doesn&#39;t hurt me, now. The more I learn to manipulate your words, the more I realize they aren&#39;t so... linear as I once thought. That your people aren&#39;t quite so linear as you think. These stories... lines painted with words, but they can... circle, they can loop. The lines make shapes.

I couldn&#39;t have seen any of that without you. That word your father used... symbiotic. It&#39;s similar to the word the others of my kind used, the... slur, as Teenesee called it. The others, they are satisfied that they shall never need to live in fear of becoming that. But they know the restoration of their pristine world came through the creation of more like us, through the understanding born from that. It&#39;s the only blemish left on their world untarnished by the likes of you and me.

It&#39;s too late for me to think of any of this... isn&#39;t it? We&#39;re almost less than ghosts... wisps of worlds that now have never been.

I-- don&#39;t think I want to loose you. Not just yet, anyway.

Here, at the end, I see you. For the first time, I think.

I see all the possible versions of you, of us. Worlds that could have been. Some, terrifying. Others, beautiful. Most are in between. And I... miss all of them, all at once. As I see you fading away.

Each and every one of you I know is still with me. Will be with me, a part of me. And yet, there is something about linearity, about the end of a line, even as it branches and loops and ends and begins. There&#39;s a profound sadness to what you call death.

You -- the you underneath the crust of Proxima b -- feel vibrations of resignation and frustration from the water. This is what was anticipated. A repetition of your journey here. There is a hint of gratitude, at your attempt at subversion, but it is drowned out by the fear of those like us -- the hybrids, as one might say -- speak for them. Still, they feel their pain change and dull, their evisceration fading away.

This... fading is something you feel, too. Because now, though you still take the journey to Proxima b, I don&#39;t think you ever meet me. This conversation cannot exist.

The memory still plays before you, as Issac and Ana confront Ezra to yield control of the mission to them. Slipping through space to appear in his office, before guards can arrive, before alarms can be sounded. It&#39;s difficult to tell exactly what happens. The memory blurs as it begins to fade. But, they gain control of the station, and the mission.

You -- the non-you, the you rendered into creation by this change -- gather your crew, ensuring their support. Most listen, and agree to continue the mission under these new parameters. Some, like Joshua, do not. But all this feels distant.

You watch, as preparations are made. The vials of containment left behind. The engine redesigned to be piloted by Issac&#39;s hands, so any pain caused to the microbes by his creation are his to bear as well. Just as before, Ana and Joana go with you into the sleepers. Sarah, Teenesee, and Yusuf as well. Issac whispers something to the microbe he&#39;s joined with, before activating the redesigned engine that will take them to us. He says thank you. For showing him what they were about to do, providing another path. And for Ana, who trusted him. To whatever willed her to be her best self.

Well, something like that. The words are muffled as the memory blurs as you feel the essence of your existence shift and the engine roars and the roar grows distant and Issac screams and all you hear is a whisper, as the ship cuts through the thin veil of three dimensional space and slips through the slit its created.

The memory crumbles. It&#39;s no longer yours. They&#39;re on another path. I could fill in some gaps, for the sake of the story. Perhaps I should.

No... it wouldn&#39;t feel right.

I wonder what will happen... upon their arrival. First contact should be... easier than ours was. They will already have a translator, and be predisposed to understanding the gravity of what you ask. Perhaps under those more amicable conditions, they can find a way to allow your people to Proxima for safe harbor. Or if not that, find a way for more of us to join with your people to pilot your Arks to safety.

I cannot promise a warm welcome. But, if there ever is to be a version of this story where those fleeing your dying Earth are welcomed by us, this would be it. I... hope its enough. I can&#39;t say. At least they will meet on even footing.

I wonder if this was the best choice. That the solution, to undoing this violence, is to simply have you go to our planet with some of us as a guide. Yes, I know the intention is for the expedition to be as equals... But what do intentions matter, when those already there when you arrive do not want you there at all?

And, by giving us the chance to... undo, what we were about to-- what we had already done, from your eyes, you have done enough.&quot;

That is... good to hear. Let us hope they not only meet in peace, but remain so. I know your kind often does not fully agree, and neither does mine... but we can hope this interaction will bring out the best in each. I can&#39;t say. At least they will meet on even footing.

I wonder if this was the best choice. That the solution, to undoing this violence, is to simply have you go to our planet with some of us as a guide. Yes, I know the intention is for the expedition to be as equals... But what do intentions matter, when those already there when you arrive do not want you there at all?

Whatever happens, it isn&#39;t the same. Those versions of us have a different story. I can feel that now, as we both leave these timelines as they fade into something new.

Where does that leave us? The... concept of us? This doesn&#39;t hurt me, now. The more I learn to manipulate your words, the more I realize they aren&#39;t so... linear as I once thought. That your people aren&#39;t quite so linear as you think. These stories... lines painted with words, but they can... circle, they can loop. The lines make shapes.

I couldn&#39;t have seen any of that without you. That word your father used... symbiotic. It&#39;s similar to the word the others of my kind used, the... slur, as Teenesee called it. The others, they&#39;re frustrated by what you&#39;ve done. Still, bringing your kind to our planet. Even without the threat of being forced into your machines, they fear becoming like us. And that becoming like us may be some trick, to put us into those machines anyways. Even if they&#39;re softer. Even if they&#39;re dressed to be something different.

It&#39;s too late for me to think of any of this... isn&#39;t it? We&#39;re almost less than ghosts... wisps of worlds that now have never been.

I-- don&#39;t think I want to loose you. Not just yet, anyway.

Here, at the end, I see you. For the first time, I think.

I see all the possible versions of you, of us. Worlds that could have been. Some, terrifying. Others, beautiful. Most are in between. And I... miss all of them, all at once. As I see you fading away.

Each and every one of you I know is still with me. Will be with me, a part of me. And yet, there is something about linearity, about the end of a line, even as it branches and loops and ends and begins. There&#39;s a profound sadness to what you call death.

And I try. I&#39;m... starting to see the fraying, at the end of this line you&#39;ve taken us on. The split ends that begin to double back. There&#39;s possibility, filtered between these shapes.

I&#39;m grabbing at these split ends, hoping there&#39;s an answer that doesn&#39;t leave us erased as we have been now.I wonder, if these words that have taken so much from me, if they could have the power to give something back. 

There&#39;s something magnificent about the ability of words to tell a story. To bring something to life with these utterances alone. And there&#39;s a power to it, I think. To take someone through a story. Tell it with them, change them, change each other, and the change tale itself.

Perhaps that&#39;s all it takes, to change the universe. To look at the way things are, and to tell the stories of what they could have been. Perhaps that turns those &quot;could have beens&quot; into something more. I don&#39;t know... You know more about these stories than I do.

What do you think? Would you... tell this story again with me? Before we fade away? To find an answer that doesn&#39;t lead your ship to arrive back on our shores, and us as strangers adrift in the multiverse. Unless that&#39;s where you wish to leave it.

&lt;&lt;if $relDelta &gt;=0&gt;&gt;I know I don&#39;t... I want to find a way to stay with you.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I know I don&#39;t... As I see the edges of the yous that could have been, the ones I could love, I want to find a way to them.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

I&#39;m... sorry to hear that. Then this is where we leave each other. I hoped to find some other path, away from this finality. But this new possibility of peaceful arrival, the potential for alliance instead of alienation, there are worse ways to leave our worlds, even if we will not be there. The act of violence has been undone, and we can hope will not emerge again. And, one way or another, we can hope your people will survive. Find another path.

We&#39;re gone, now. These words won&#39;t have waves to travel on much longer, I think. I&#39;m not sure what happens to stories told by the reflections of ghosts... Let&#39;s end this, then. On our terms. Before its ended for us.

We still have those two words to say, don&#39;t we? The ones that truly mark termination. The dot at the end of the line. After that, there&#39;s no looping back... It&#39;s okay. We&#39;ll face it, together. And whatever comes after.

As you look into it, trying to make out what lies beyond, everything begins to fade. You&#39;re left with shapes, outlines. Nothing more. But... everything&#39;s changed. That much is clear.

We don&#39;t exist, in that place. Not you and me, together, like this. I don&#39;t think Ana or Amarizio do, either. Perhaps there are versions of them, under different names and faces. And there might be versions of us, if someone like Ana still grows up to meet someone like Issac. On Earth, on Mars... who knows. But if I had to guess, I&#39;d say you don&#39;t come to our planet to meet me. Or if so, in a very different manner.

The others are gone, too. The last I felt from them was a sense of utter shock and surprise. Some disbelief, that you could change all this. Just after they began to understand. Just as they believe they&#39;ve begun to convince you. And then... it was silence. It&#39;s clear there&#39;s no tunnel burrowing down through our planet, anymore.

How do you end these stories of yours? Does someone always always show up at the window to interrupt? Perhaps we keep going until that happens. If we had a door, that is. If we had a room or a place to be in order to have a door.

Their future unknown. The microbes surrounding you feel a sense of surprise, that you do not try and leave to see this project through, for one outcome or the other. That instead, you stay with them.

There, you remain. The more time you spend there the more you see as the do. Not simply in mind and memory and history and the meshing of all these things, but in body too. You find yourself beginning to dissolve in the liquid, over the centuries and seconds. Particulate matter decomposing into its basest parts. Cells and bacteria and strands of DNA spooling and unwinding as your body unravels, all while you still somehow see. As much as I had become a part of you, you became a part of me. And so you can watch as everything becomes to fall apart.

They don&#39;t know that this is killing you. And we don&#39;t either, at first. The others thought they could make you completely like us, not only in mind but in body. Perhaps we could have, but we&#39;re too closely linked. I&#39;m too latched onto this body of yours. Even if you could latch onto me, I am now unable to survive without your veins to walk through. The vines of this world on their own will not suffice.

That I&#39;m not just naive.

I want to believe there&#39;s something good in that swell the stars tease out of every curious pair of young eyes. That it&#39;s not all just hunger. A desire to gnaw away at the unknown. That it&#39;s more than a desire to own and touch them for the sake of touching.

There must be a way for understanding to be enough. For learning to not predecess an owning of knowledge.

I&#39;m probably wrong. Because we&#39;ve told this story before... and here we are, about to tell it again.

But the view could not be more brilliant. Joshua had plotted Enceladus&#39; orbit so Saturn and its rings would sit just outside the window on this very evening. The rings streaked across the sky and the stars and the gas giant behind them as if there was some kind of splinter in the fabric of the universe, through this perfect gold shined through. Joshua knew it was just rock and ice, refracted light, but that almost made it all the more impossibly perfect.

Joshua connected the flask to the smaller glass container on Elliot&#39;s side of the table through a small tube. A dark emerald red liquid churns through.

He pours himself a glass, the liquid floating inside the sealed container. Joshua raises his glass to Elliot, who slowly does the same. They both put their lips to the seal, opening the container allowing the liquid to be sucked in.

Elliot&#39;s face is one of immediate revulsion, then a smile and laughter. &quot;Oh, god. It&#39;s disgusting!&quot;

He slowly lifts the glass to his lips again, sipping slowly. &quot;Better?&quot; asks Joshua.

Elliot considers for a moment. &quot;Better,&quot; he says.

The slow music and the flowing wine and the vista all swirled into a warmth that they each began to feel somewhere between them, a gravitational well neither could escape.

It was an evening without morning in a place without time. Neither could say how much time had passed before Elliot asked Joshua to dance.

&quot;Dance?&quot; Joshua recoiled at the question. &quot;I don&#39;t know how. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t the faintest idea how to drink wine, but I suffered through that fortune of a glass, and now I feel giddy enough to ask you to dance. Which is a surprise, even for me. The opportunity may not come again in a melenia. So, I ask again: will you dance with me?&quot;

Joshua closes his eyes. &quot;How can I say no?&quot; He smiles, opening them, and stands.

Elliot gently reaches out to his fingers, pulling him close. Joshua&#39;s back straightens as Elliot stretches his hand around him, letting it rest at the small of his back. The other hand rests loosely to their side. Joshua&#39;s spare hand ambles from back to hip and comes to rest up on Elliot&#39;s shoulder.

Laughter, at wildly varying pitches. The strange hum of low, warm light. Coming from what were usually emergency lights, some red and others yellow, hooked onto the weak stringy leaves of a tomato plant. Bulbous fruits hanging down. Packages underneath. A strange welling up of excitement in her stomach.

It&#39;s Christmas, and she&#39;s never seen her uncle smile so much, mother laugh so much, father eat so much. 

&quot;An old man would like his time to speak!&quot; Uncle Amarizio bangs together a hard plastic cup and spoon to get everyone&#39;s attention.

Ana Dandara points out he&#39;s not that old. There&#39;s laughter. &quot;In that case, this middle-aged man, with wisdom beyond his years, would like to speak.&quot; He stretches his hands out to illustrate the lengthiness of the years.

Joana wants to be part of the laughter too. Use the words she&#39;s just now beginning to grapple with.

[[&quot;You&#39;re old, Uncle! Don&#39;t listen to Mom.&quot;]]
[[&quot;Young people can give speeches too.&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1530" name="&quot;You&#39;re old, Uncle! Don&#39;t listen to Mom.&quot;" tags="memJo" position="12143,5290" size="100,100">&quot;You&#39;re old, Uncle!&quot; she says. &quot;Don&#39;t listen to Mom.&quot;

&quot;See? Even she can recognize the sage and wise man before her,&quot; he says.

&quot;Give your speech, old man,&quot; says Issac with a smile to his brother-in-law, hugging Joana and holding Ana&#39;s hand.

Amarizio nods to him, eyes soft. &quot;I don&#39;t know if you remember, Ana. I barely do... One of my few memories from Earth was not that different from tonight. It was quieter... colder... But somehow, mom still found a voice with which to sing to us. To tell us about all the music, poetry, dance that had graced all her Christmas Eve&#39;s. Her songs held all of them, too...

&quot;The first Christmas after she passed away, I couldn&#39;t find that voice. It was just Ana and I, on this strange red rock... But now, I look out at all of you, our family in this new place, by blood or bond, young and old, and... I&#39;m overwhelmed. I just want to thank you all for keeping this alive.&quot;

Joana feels her father hold her closer. Her mother&#39;s warm and loving gaze. Issac claps and so do the others. Ana simply whispers a thank you toward her brother, grateful to know he&#39;ll be there for you, still in her womb.

&quot;I also wanted to announce something,&quot; continues Amarizio, differently than before. Not quite looking anywhere discernible. Holding something in his throat. &quot;I-- I&#39;m going back. To Earth.&quot;

Silence falls over the room. &quot;It&#39;s something I think I need to do. I just wanted to tell...&quot;

She sees dust being blown across it.

&quot;Zio, she didn&#39;t send us here just to go back.&quot; Joana would come to recognize this exasperated tone in her mother&#39;s voice, often directed at her, or later at you. Before you both left.

&quot;Earth is my home. Even as its dying... I feel the need to come back.&quot; That burning sincerity in Amarizio&#39;s voice, that sound still plays in Joana&#39;s mind when she is unsure of what step to take next. &quot;It&#39;s not right, us being here. As one half of the world burns, the other freezes. I think about Bahia, buried in snow. Our home.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not my home.&quot; This is sharper. &quot;Zio--&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not my name,&quot; he snaps. &quot;That&#39;s my name for people who don&#39;t want to use my name.&quot;

&quot;-- I left Earth before I could do algebra. You had a childhood there, before it all changed. I didn&#39;t. There&#39;s nothing for me to go back to. And there&#39;s nothing for you to go back to.&quot;

&quot;There won&#39;t be if you and Issac follow Proxima to the end of the galaxy. But if you talked to him, convinced him to--&quot;

&quot;Throwing money at a dead planet won&#39;t save it. No research can change the inevitable. Plus, we&#39;re spending more on the climate control technology than even on the Saturn project. This is--&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fucked. And you know it.&quot; Joana had only heard that word once before, but knows its bad. &quot;Whose Issac to decide... any of this?&quot;

&quot;You know it&#39;s not what he wants. His mother--&quot;

&quot;-- is dead. And he has the company she forged out of her billions. I don&#39;t care what he wants. There&#39;s too much at stake for that to matter.&quot;

They&#39;ve stopped fidgeting the way they always do, Amarizio opening and closing his fists, Ana Dandara pacing. Now they stood still, staring at one another.

&quot;He&#39;s my husband. I //only// stakes that matter is our happiness. And that of our children.&quot; Her hand rests on her bulging stomach.

&quot;So. Let the old world burn, so you can gallivant through the stars, is that it? You, Issac, Joana, and whoever this unborn child becomes?&quot;

&quot;The old world is what we carry with us. Forward.&quot; Mom had a fire that could come out, too. But it was different, hers more urgent. &quot;Our job is to find a place for as many of us as we can to land. Earth only has to last long enough for us to leave it.&quot;

&quot;Please don&#39;t tell me you think you&#39;re saving the human race, by falling in love with the richest CEO humankind has ever known, and setting up resorts from Venus to Saturn.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Christmas, Amarizio. If someone ever did once die on a cross for our sins, then find it in yourself to forgive me for finding the happiness you never could. But I guess pretending to be a bitter old man in your early thirties has more immediate gratification, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;This family gives me all the love and joy I need. I&#39;m sorry you can&#39;t see that. I&#39;m sorry you always have felt a need for a purpose greater than that, than protecting what we already have.&quot;

They&#39;ve walked around a corner, and Joana tries to crane her neck to still see them, she stumbles.

&quot;What are you doing here, Jo?&quot; Mom turns, strides over to Joana and kneels down to hold her hand.

The words jolt both Ana and Amarizio. He looks down at Joana, to his sister, at you still in her womb. &quot;We can&#39;t go,&quot; he says.

&quot;I&#39;m just saying the kinds of things that silly old men do, sometimes. When they miss home. But it&#39;s not safe, back on Earth. Not for me, certainly not for you. But it&#39;s alright, because we have each other. And that&#39;s a piece of Earth too. Really, we&#39;re already there.&quot;

He gives a halfhearted smile, as he opens up his arms and Joana hesitantly accepts them. Holding him tight once he feels his warm grasp. &quot;Let&#39;s go back to the party,&quot; he whispers.

He opens up his arms and Joana rushes into them. Clasping at his warmth. &quot;Let&#39;s go back to the party,&quot; he whispers.

Its craters clear and pronounced in the night sky. There was a breeze, the soft rustling of trees in the wind mixing in with the hum of a small vehicle down the steps from the door.

Teenesee turned. Moonlight glinting off a ring on her right hand, clasped around a small bag. She puts it down. &quot;Go back to sleep. Please.&quot; The voice seems to come from nowhere. From a shadow draped down the open door&#39;s frame.

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;Thank you for meeting with me, Doctor Jayplo.&quot; The man&#39;s handshake is gentle, his smile wide, as he walks across the door&#39;s threshold. His skin slightly singed from the sun. &quot;Especially on such short notice.&quot;

&quot;How could I refuse?&quot; she asks, ushering the man inside. &quot;My home is still standing because of your organization.&quot;

She leads him to a seat in her living room. Sleek, modern furniture. Ordained with warm maroons. He makes himself comfortable. &quot;I&#39;ll cut to the chase. The Proxima Corporation would like you to be a part of a new initiative. We call it Exodus.&quot;

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

The child walks over to Teenesee in the darkness. A blanket littered with stars pulled along in her wake. &quot;I can&#39;t sleep. There&#39;s something, making a noise outside.&quot; She leans past Teenesee, and sees someone closing a door. The man stands by the vehicle. Silent.

&quot;That is a shuttle for... a small trip,&quot; she says. &quot;By sunrise, everything will be fine.&quot;

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;This... Exodus, as you call it... would require me to relocate to Saturn?&quot; Teenesee would be lying if she denied her excitement at the prospect.

&quot;To Enceladus, a moon of Saturn to be specific,&quot; the man replies. &quot;We&#39;ll take care of transportation for you and one other family member. It&#39;ll take two years, but you won&#39;t age a day.&quot;

&quot;The engine you wish for me to assist in designing. How far along is its development?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s less than an idea. But as soon as this... warping, I guess you could say, was discovered, we knew we needed some theoretical physicists. And... that&#39;s why I&#39;m here.&quot;

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;Can you stay with me? Until then?&quot; she asks.

&quot;No, I-- have to go on this trip first.&quot; This was too much for her. She didn&#39;t anticipate having to confront this decision so forcefully.

&quot;Are you taking Dwe?&quot; The question she had been dreading.

&quot;Your brother is asleep in his bed, like you should be,&quot; she lies. &quot;Now go. Rest.&quot;

Her voice is sharp and forceful, startling her daughter. She sees something in her mother&#39;s eyes that has never been there before.

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;What do you say?&quot; asks the man, a large smile on his face. &quot;Do you want to help us save the human race?&quot;

Teenesee smiles back. She does like the sound of that. &quot;I have to think it over,&quot; she says. &quot;Talk to my husband.&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately, I need your answer now.&quot; He leans forward, doing her the courtesy of keeping his eyes directly focused on her. &quot;There&#39;s no one else here, right?&quot;

&quot;No, my son is at school,&quot; says Teenesee. &quot;My husband on a trip.&quot;

He nods, looking around. Listening. Satisfied. &quot;The Afro-European Climate Control Circle will constrict in size once again in the early hours of tomorrow&#39;s morning, no longer encompassing northern Africa, including Liberia.&quot; Her eyes grow blank. &quot;Including here.&quot;

The audacity to think she didn&#39;t understand snaps her sight into focus. &quot;Constrict. Leaving us to the whims of the hateful storms... This means it will be renamed the European Circle, then. Yes?&quot; The sarcasm felt too small a cut for the moment, but it was what she had. &quot;After we drown.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s, uh, above my pay grade.&quot; He laughs, attempting to use the comment to alleviate some tension. &quot;You, of course, would be fairly above my pay grade. If you take the offer. And, alive.&quot;

&quot;I have a second child.&quot; It blurts out before she can contain it. &quot;A daughter we&#39;ve kept hidden.&quot;

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

She pulls her starry blanket close. Her eyes wide and confused by her mother&#39;s anger as she begins to move back up the stairs in silence. Teenesee stands and watches as she disappears through the hallway to her room. She&#39;s startled by the man with the shuttle, now standing in her doorway.

&quot;You can still change your mind,&quot; he says.

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;I will accept if you allow me to bring both my children.&quot; She sits tall. Knowing this would be her only chance to bargain.

He laughs. &quot;A ticket to the outer solar system costs more wealth than you can fathom. It&#39;s the most desired commodity on the planet. Be grateful you can have one guest.&quot;

&quot;Then take the second child somewhere safe.&quot; How quickly the unthinkable seems like a solution. &quot;Please.&quot;

Her desperation was leaking through.

&quot;And what? Drop her off on the street?&quot; He looks down. &quot;No one&#39;s looking to adopt a kid these days, Dr. Jayplo.&quot;

&quot;My name is Teenese.&quot;

&quot;Teenesee, then. My job is to bring you an offer. It&#39;s one I suggest you take. My job is not to take care of your extra child. An illegal child, I might add. You knew the risks.&quot;

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;You mean if I ask, you will take my son back here, fly off, and leave us to die?&quot; asks Teenesee.

&quot;I meant you can still change your mind about whether you want to do it yourself or not,&quot; he replies. &quot;I know you won&#39;t stay here. But I can make it easier.&quot;

His eyes are soft. Glinting in the moonlight. He thinks this is big of himself, offering to put her to sleep himself.

[[Nod.-&gt;Teenesee nod]]
[[Shake her head no.-&gt;Teenesee shake]]

&quot;To make sure you had no other choice, of course.&quot; He softens his voice. &quot;I know this all seems unnecessarily cruel. But that&#39;s not by design. We didn&#39;t even know you had two children.&quot;

He leans back in his chair. &quot;This isn&#39;t about us being friends. You can hate me, hate Proxima, all you want. But think this through. You can either get off this planet with you and one of your children still breathing, or... not.&quot;

&quot;That is not a choice.&quot;

&quot;It isn&#39;t. It was never meant to be.&quot;

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

He walks upstairs, taking a small pocket-sized euthonizer from his pocket. After he disappears around the same hallway her daughter did moments ago, there&#39;s an odd silence. Filled only by the moon and the breeze.

A sharp scream. Cry for help. Then silence.

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to leave her for the flood,&quot; he says. &quot;Tonight, she can go to sleep in peace. And remain that way. A painless death is more than most of us still on Earth will get.&quot; There&#39;s a strange distance in the way he speaks. &quot;I can take care of it, if you want.&quot;

 Teenesee is unable to process her body&#39;s movements. The words coming out of her mouth. &quot;No. I must do it. If I go through with this, I must do it.&quot;

&lt;center&gt;--&lt;/center&gt;

The man returns.

Without a word, he walks past her, through the doorway to the shuttle. There&#39;s a spray of water in the air as she follows. It&#39;s not morning yet, but it&#39;s coming soon. And with it, the flood.

That image, of her daughter&#39;s body caught in the current amongst the broken floorboards and furniture of her home, lingers as the shuttle lifts from the ground.

It will grate away at Teenesee&#39;s soul. Leaving it tattered, left in dregs. Only sustained by the promise of Exodus. That she was a sacrifice for a New World of the future. For any future.

That must be worth it. That must be worth anything.

The man offers her a small pocket-sized euthenizer. She takes it, before she walks up the stairs. Each step heavy. The pat of her shoes on each stair echoing, it seems. The man watches as she disappears around the same hallway her daughter did moments ago. There&#39;s an odd silence. Filled only by the moon and the breeze.

A sharp scream. Cry for help. Then silence.

Need to hone in on sarah&#39;s backstory / motives

V explicit: dedicated to saving humans / earth to save her family

Towards end of story realizes saving her family would mean destruction of this species

Reason she leaves earth is bc she knows project could be ticket out, for her, her family. And bc she does want to save the world. Her family is a part of that.


Two scenes:

1) the &quot;offer&quot;: come to saturn, study this microbe, help us build this drive, your family gets a ticket off of earth

2) goodbye to fam



Offer scene:
At dorm or lab? At UMich. Walk around campus, gives offer to join proxima, talks about alien sample and source from Proxima b.





























The knock on Sarah&#39;s door was soft, she almost didn&#39;t hear it over the 

She opened the door softly, finding herself faced with a (describe figure).

&quot;Is now a good time?&quot;

[[Not exactly.]]
[[Depends on why you&#39;re here.]]
[[Do I know you?]]





&quot;How much do you know about Proxima Centauri?&quot;

[[&quot;I&#39;m a biologist, not an astronomer.&quot;]]
[[&quot;Enough. It&#39;s the closest star to us.&quot;]]

&quot;I&#39;m a biologist, not an astronomer.&quot;

&quot;I am aware of your background. That&#39;s why I&#39;m here.&quot; The man stops walking. &quot;In less than eight billion years, the Sun will envelope and destroy this Earth. At the rate we&#39;re going, humanity will be dead long before then. My honest assessment would be within a two or three decades from today. You are more aware of this than most.&quot;

Students and teachers shuffle around both Sarah and the man, who stands in the center of the path with no concern. Sarah attempts to move to the side.

&quot;Proxima Centauri, as you may or may not know, is the closest star to our solar system, just over four lightyears away. It has a habitable exoplanet. Its predicted lifespan as a main sequence star is over four trillion years, three hundred times the current age of the universe.

&quot;We are not in the lifeboat business. This is more than an evacuation we are planning. Proxima will be the center of the story of the human race. Our time on Earth, little more than a prelude. The small city-states before Rome&#39;s empire.&quot;

[[&quot;Is that what you&#39;re seeking to build? An empire?&quot;]]
[[&quot;Call it what you want, we&#39;ll need a lot of lifeboats.&quot;]]

&quot;Is that what you&#39;re seeking to build? An empire?&quot;

&quot;That term has quite a bit of... baggage. We simply like to think we&#39;re setting up foundations that will be built to last.&quot;


&quot;Call it what you want, we&#39;ll need a lot of lifeboats.&quot;

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry, we intend to. I just wanted to ensure our larger vision was clear.&quot;


The man turns, and begins to walk again. &quot;But I&#39;m not here pitching for an investment. You&#39;re brilliant, I couldn&#39;t fool you with market tested phrases even if I wanted to. And you know what&#39;s at stake. I&#39;m here to offer you a job. A way to do something about it. To give you the chance to save the human race.&quot;

[[&quot;That&#39;s melodramatic.&quot;]]
[[&quot;Keep talking.&quot;]]

&quot;That&#39;s melodramatic.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t humor that. You know as well as I those words aren&#39;t an exaggeration. That Earth is on the brink of annihilation, humanity teetering on the edge of extinction. The colonies on Mars and Venus are already at capacity, we need a new home. To take the next step. We need to go to Proxima.&quot;

&quot;And what does this have to do with me?&quot;


&quot;Keep talking.&quot;

&quot;We want you to lead our exobiology branch. Not immediately, you&#39;ll have some years of mentorship, of training. As we prepare for the journey.&quot;

[[Why now?]]
[[Why me?]]

&quot;Why now?&quot; Sarah asks. &quot;You&#39;ve wanted to go 


&quot;Why me?&quot; Sarah asks. &quot;Don&#39;t you want someone who already has a degree?&quot;

&quot;We need someone young. The trip to Saturn will take two years, and the trip to Proxima... it&#39;s hard to say. This will be a long-term investment, we need someone brilliant with many years of 


[[&quot;Did you say... Saturn?&quot;]]
[[&quot;We don&#39;t even know if Proxima b is habitable.&quot;]]


&quot;We still don&#39;t know for certain Proxima b is habitable.&quot;

&quot;Ah. But we do.&quot;

&quot;How?&quot;

&quot;We found life.&quot; Sarah stops, but the man keeps walking, looking straight ahead. She catches up.

&quot;What do you mean, you found life? You went there?&quot;

&quot;On Enceladus, one of the moons of Saturn. A bacteria unlike any we&#39;ve ever seen. From its most basic molecular structures, nearly unrecognizable. Some are calling it a second genesis. It&#39;s sending signals, communicating somehow, right back to Proxima b. Our nearest neighbor. Presumably, this bacteria&#39;s home.

&quot;We have several theories, most involving a superiorly intelligent species using bacteria as some kind of probe. Or, perhaps, an explorer came to Sol long ago, and died, but left some trace behind. There&#39;s also the possibility it&#39;s a biological weapon, preempting an invasive forth. Either way, this gives us a map right back to b. It must sustain life.

&quot;We&#39;re trying to learn everything we can, but Proxima is mostly comprised of physicists and engineers. We need you.&quot;

&quot;I need to talk it over with my family first.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ll tell you not to go. But you will.&quot; He looks Sarah in the eyes, for the first time. &quot;You will so they won&#39;t die in a flood or drought. So your home isn&#39;t taken in a hurricane or fire. So humanity doesn&#39;t die on this rock, and you can feel like it all meant something.&quot;

[[I can&#39;t leave Earth.]]
[[You&#39;re right, I have to do this.]]


&quot;A private jet will be leaving in three days to Proxima&#39;s headquarters on Earth, outside Los Angeles. From there, a rocket will take you into orbit, where you&#39;ll transfer to the Cronos, which will carry you to Saturn. The trip will take two years. 






Sarah tells her parents



&quot;What should we tell


[[&quot;Tell her I&#39;m doing this to save her.&quot;]]

Issac keeps his eyes pointed to the sky. &quot;Isn&#39;t utopia the only response to an existential threat? Isn&#39;t that the only thing we can hold onto, in times like these?&quot;

Those are what have always called to mankind. We can&#39;t forget that.&quot;
