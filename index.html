&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Frank Tavares&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Questions&lt;/u&gt;

What have you accomplished so far?

I have completed most of a very rough first draft. Currently, I have drafts of 6 chapters, of an expected total of 8 chapters. The last two chapters are outlined in broad strokes, and I suspect I can have them finished within one or two weeks. There are also a series of other "flashback" scenes, some of which appear between chapters, that I've written. Most of this writing is unedited, and the technical aspects of the project are currently very bare-bones, with notes to myself of code that should be implemented and errors where the code that is there is off.

Has anything in your project changed over the past months?

Yes. At the start of the summer, I completely re-drafted the plot outline I had been working with. The main motivation of this was to narrow the scope of the project, and construct a plot that would more directly deal with the themes I want to tackle: the tension between exploration and exploitation. Instead of starting the story in an already established colony within our solar system, the new plot follows explorers arriving on an alien planet, and making decisions about how they interact with that environment and the life they come in contact with there. I've been able to carry forward much of the writing I did last fall, since most of the characters are the same, as well as the background and worldbuilding.

What's your plan of action going forward?

My immediate goal is to finish my first draft, which I am hoping to do within two weeks. After that, I want to do one read through and round of editing on my own, mostly to "clean up" the draft. Then, I am planning to reach out for readers and get external feedback. While that is happening, I'll also be working to get the technical aspects of the project in place. That includes integrating variables that trace important choices in the story and how they carry forward, as well as making aesthetic choices for the presentation of the digital project.

I have also found collaborators to help produce some visuals and sound to accompany the written story. Depending on how far along those aspects are, I'd start to incorporate those as well.

After a second round of edits on the draft of my creative piece, I will start to work on the critical component of the project. Originally, I had imagined this would simply be a space to discuss my thinking behind the story and weave in the texts that have inspired and influenced me. However, I just recently had the idea of perhaps having the critical component be influenced by the choices made particularly towards the end of the story. So, different story "endings" could result in a different critical text to read after. This isn't a developed idea at all, and would broaden the scope of the critical component, but is something I'm keeping in mind going forward.

Do you feel like you're on track to finish by the end of November?

Yes. I am behind my original target of having a complete first draft by the start of classes, but am not too worried. I am confident I will have a finished draft by the end of November, recognizing that if I reach a time crunch I can scale back certain aspects of the project (such as the visuals or sound) that can be added on as a continuation of the project.


&lt;u&gt;Sample&lt;/u&gt;

My current draft has 6 very rough chapters, of an expected 8 total chapters. There will also be a prologue which I have brainstormed, but not written, which will diegetically have the reader choose the protagonist's first name. For now, I just have a simple prompt.

(The story begins with a circle on the screen. It's perfectly round, against a while background. There's nothing else. At any click, the Circle breaks (ideally at the point closest to the click, but if not, that's okay). It starts to flatten out and then turns into a line.) OR (bends into an oval, like the shape of the ship? The oval flattens and flattens until it simply becomes a line. Text fades in.)

//The soil was its home for all time. Until all time became something else. You found it, scrapped it of the floor of an ocean buried beneath the ice of what you call a moon.//

I can feel my hatred and love for you all in one. See all the versions of us that are happy those that were driven to kill each other and those that didn't care. Those are the worst, I think. I keep... chasing the paths where we find our ways into harmony. But there's always a branch that snags me, pulls me off. I never can get the right one. I can never see past the thorns.

I've started trying to get used to their pricks.


//






























//
I wish we could stay on this page forever. You and me, just... sitting in the blank space before and after everything begins to turn.

From here, I can see all of you. Each inflection, split, alternative. Those I loath and those I love. And as soon as I continue, they splinter. Narrow and expand.

There aren't many things I love about these words, that have taken so much from me. But the canvas of a first page will never cease to give me hope. The elegance of a story, the perverse pleasure of controlling it and telling it: those gifts I treasure. Those gifts I thank you for.

This is the beginning. This is the end. These are both lies. These are both truths.

You live in three dimensions. I live in four. I lived in four. Your machines changed that, forced us into three. You have no words... for that. But I will try. I want you to attempt and imagine being flattened. Now, when I say that, I can see the image: a bulldozer running over you. A machine pulling you thin like putty. That isn't it. That isn't it at all. Imagine you were taken from three dimensions into two. Imagine space-time as you know it was stretched to infinity until all that was left was a sliver, and the concept of thickness could not be recalled from your brain.

What do you think that would do to your body? Can you fathom that? Loosing yourself... watching it slip away like sand... you're trying to grab on and trying to grab on but then your fingers start to disintegrate and melt away and it's all you can do to hold onto that silver that's left. That silver that's left.





There is a whisper, at the end. Words barely breathed out from lips holding onto thin wisps of air. Please, hold on. There is still so much potential in a breath or two. A word or two more.

There is a beauty in a line. In a beginning, and in an end. In how a line can bend to create a circle in how a circle can bend to create a line.

All shapes are the same.

Everything... was a circle.

Until you broke it. When the time came for your arrival. And the silver stone came down from the sky. Something broke, I don't think it can be fixed.

I just want to know why. Perhaps, telling this story will help me understand.










I am astounded by the possibility of a beginning.

There was no such thing, to me, before we met you. Being here, at the start of a story, it seems odd. Because genuinely, I do not know how it will end.

Eyes blink open. You are inside a container, strapped down. The upper half is glass, frosted over. You feel spikes crawl up your fingers and toes as warmth ripples through them. "Wake up. You have arrived. Wake up." Your skin is cold.

But asking these questions only makes you feel more lost. You probe the back of your brain, hammering it for any morsel of memory before the smell of gas only moments before. There's nothing. Everything is nauseating. The blue light. The door. The voice. Your body drifts and the room spins and you want to wake up from what can only be a nightmare. But even in dreams, you're supposed to remember your name. 

Something changes in one of the pods. You catch it, from the corner of your eye. You turn to face them, now directly above you. The frost is fading from five of the glass panels.

[[Did they know me?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="56" name="Will they remember?" tags="" position="5660,160">"Will they remember?" You think you see an open hazel eye from Sarah's container.

"It depends upon whether there was a malfunction only in your sleeper's process that caused memory loss, or something deeper within the system effecting everyone." An open, gasping mouth flashes from Joshua's container. "I suspect we shall find out soon."

A fist pushes through the gas in Yusuf's container, and then snaps back. He must be struggling with the constraints, you think. The gas starts to fade away, and full faces begin to emerge. Teeneese's eyes are open, darting around as the ceiling comes into view for her. They rest when they find you, and tighten.

Joana's mouth is wide open, throat vibrating. You hear nothing on the other side of the glass, but her screams are clear. Arms flailing. You see Sarah and Joshua's lips moving slowly. There's a panic in Joshua's eyes as he turns in his container, looking for the source of CINDI's voice asking for identification. Sarah's eyes find you, and then turn away, as she continues to reason with the artificial intelligence. Yusuf's lips are still as he feels the sides of his container, pushing at it as much as the constraints allow, looking for a weakness. Teeneese's eyes still rest squarely on you without wavering. Joana's eyes find you, floating above her. She stretches out a finger towards you, quickly pulled back to the container's base, redirecting her silent screams towards you instead of the sentient voice.

A fist pushes through the gas in Yusuf's container, and then snaps back. He must be struggling with the constraints, you think. The gas starts to fade away, and full faces begin to emerge. Teeneese's eyes are open, darting around as the ceiling comes into view for her. They rest when they find you, and tighten.

Joana's mouth is wide open, throat vibrating. You hear nothing on the other side of the glass, but her screams are clear. Arms flailing. You see Sarah and Joshua's lips moving slowly. There's a panic in Joshua's eyes as he turns in his container, looking for the source of CINDI's voice asking for identification. Sarah's eyes find you, and then turn away, as she continues to reason with the artificial intelligence. Yusuf's lips are still as he feels the sides of his container, pushing at it as much as the constraints allow, looking for a weakness. Teeneese's eyes still rest squarely on you without wavering. Joana's eyes find you, floating above her. She stretches out a finger towards you, quickly pulled back to the container's base, redirecting her silent screams towards you instead of the sentient voice.

Names you should know. But as each slowly finds their way to noticing the body they see floating above them as they sit in captivity, you find nothing but fear and confusion and anger in their faces.

The silence is broken by the sound of five glass panels lifting and sliding off the chambers. In an instant, there's a cacophony of sounds. Yells and grunts from the people struggling against their constraints, turning into surprise as their released. And Joana's voice rising above the others.

"What the fuck is this? What the fu--" She stops as she feels herself floating up from the container. "Who the fuck are you, and what did you do to me?" Her eyes are red. "Why can't I remember shit?"

Joshua has been watching without comment, bewildered. "So it's not just me. None of us can remember... anything?"

The undercurrent of fear that each tried to cover up in their own way -- some through anger, or logic -- was bubbling to the surface.

"My memory is a void." Yusuf's voice was low. Teeneese looked down.

If we're making it up on the spot, or if it's coming from who we were, leaking from behind the wall it's blocked behind. But I hope, whoever you are, however that you is coming into being... please be good."

[[Why are you telling me this?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="88" name="I... will." tags="" position="8860,160">"I... will." You look back with Sarah at everyone else. At your crew.

"I wonder how you got to be Captain. We elect you? Assigned to us? Mutiny?" She turns back. "I guess we'll never know."

You both hear a voice from the other end of the ship. "Hey! I found something." Teeneese's head appears floating sideways from the smaller door's archway, beside the control panel. "Storage lockers. With our names on them. And all we need to open them are our hands." She holds both of hers out. "And some weird suits..."

Joshua, Joana, and Yusuf stand straight, and hurridly make their way over.

"Can't have forgotten our hands, right?" Yusuf says on his way. You and Sarah join them.

There is a small corridor through the door. Lining both sides are a series of lockers, nine total, each with a name on them, and a hand-shaped indent. On the far side is a large closet, one door pulled slightly to the side. In the opening, you see the arm of a clean white suit hanging out. It looks like a life-sized plastic model.

"Look," says Teeneese, her voice bringing you back to the lockers. As she puts her hand against the locker with her name, there's a small hiss as the air decompresses, and it swings toward her. "I can open it."

"They must be hazard suits of some kind," says Sarah, whose locker is close. "For whatever is beyond the door."

There's a green flash as the device reads your finger and palm prints, and identifies that you are, indeed, yourself. The hiss, again, as the locker door opens. Inside, you find nothing. The locker is empty. You feel the inside, looking for a hidden compartment, something you may have missed. But there's nothing. Quietly, you close the locker.

"Not bringing anything to show and tell?" Joana asks as she hears the locker close.

[[No. I'm leaving my things here.]]

"See how it is." She closed her locker. Between her fingers, you saw what looked like a postcard or Polaroid photo.

(CHANGE: JOSHUAS UKELELE)
Looking down the hall, you saw everyone looking through their belongings. Yusuf is holding some kind of digitally projected sphere, glitching on and off. Joshua pulls out what looks like a ukulele, tentatively plucking at its strings. Teeneese is looking at something small, in her hand, but you can't see what. Sarah is clipping something to her earlobes.

[[Ask Sarah about the earings.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="99" name="It was empty." tags="" position="9910,110">"It was empty." The whirlpool underneath your feet swung back as the words slipped out.

"Empty? Fuck." She closed his locker and turns to you. "This was in mine."

She hands you what looks like a Polaroid. There are four figures in the photo, two in the back, one in the front, another in someone's arms. On the righ, you see a smaller, younger Joana staring back. Her hair longer, smile wider.

The two people in the back stood close. On the right, a tall lanky man, eyes blue and hair a dirty blond. Wry smile. In his arms, a child. Small enough to fit comfortably in the corner of his elbow and arm. On the left, a slightly shorter woman, brown eyes and tightly curled black hair. You notice her arm stretching behind the man's back, hand resting on his shoulder.

[[It could be fake.]]
[[We look so happy.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="100" name="It could be fake." tags="" position="10060,160">"It could be fake." The cynicism tastes bad on your lips.

"Doesn't feel fake." Joana shakes her head. "Feels like I had a family I loved and that loved me, and now all I've got is an empty head."

The figures seem to be standing inside of some kind of glass dome. Through the glass, a dusty red and rocky landscape stretches out. Mountains stretch up in the distance, touching a sky at dusk, stars beginning to make their way out as a sun begins to hide behind the horizon's peaks.

[[Where is that?]]
[[It's beautiful, wherever we were.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="101" name="We look so happy." tags="" position="10160,160">"We look so happy." You try stretching your eyes wide, like they are in the picture.

"Fuck if I know." She sighs. "Bet my ass it's not where we are now."


"It's beautiful, wherever we were." It almost looked as if the liquid from the geysers sprinkled out into the star-scape.

"How do we know that looks beautiful? If all we can remember seeing is these two fucking rooms?" She sighs. 

[[Ask to hold onto the photo.]]
[[Give the photo back.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="103" name="Ask to hold onto the photo." tags="" position="10360,160">"Do you mind if I hold onto this?" You tenderly hold the photo.

(if positive relationship) "Sure. You didn't hold onto shit, apparently, so you probably were an asshole of a sibling. But maybe you don't have to be." She grabs your shoulder blade, and tries to give it a comforting pat, sending both of you floating away from each other in the microgravity.

(if negative relationship) "You didn't hold onto shit, that's on you. Not me." She grabs the photo back, tugging softly, to ensure it's not damaged. "Must have been an asshole sibling, anyway." She brushes past you as he moves back towards the main room, knocking you onto a slow spin in the microgravity.

(CHANGE: JOSHUAS UKELELE)
Looking down the hall, you saw everyone looking through their belongings. Yusuf is holding some kind of digitally projected sphere, glitching on and off. Joshua pulls out what looks like a ukulele, tentatively plucking at its strings. Teeneese is looking at something small, in her hand, but you can't see what.

"It's a compass." You see him clicking the device, trying to get it to work properly. "It's broken, but clearly a three dimensional compass. Look, there's a line in the projected sphere. But each time it glitches, the direction changes."

People turn, but don't follow. You move into the doorway. In hard syllables, Teeneese's voice rings out. Everyone's chatter falls silent. "Designation number: 06-11-2073."

"Thank you for your designation number, Teeneese Jayplo." CINDI's voice had a hint of relief. "Clearance Level 3 unlocked."

Teeneese exhaled and let her muscles loosen. You move back into the main room, and the others follow. She turns to you all.

"How did you know your number?" Joana asks, walking towards her. "Rest of us don't remember shit, and you know your designation number."

"I don't need to tell you how I found it." Her eyes didn't waver, her voice didn't raise.

"Actually, you do." He paused, breathing heavily. "Because I don't know shit about you. You don't know shit about you. So anyone keeping secrets makes me pretty fucking nervous."

"Someone who picks fights with anyone he can makes me nervous." You notice her fist is still clenched.

Teeneese sighs. "This isn't worth the argument." She opens up her fist. Inside is a small, silver ring. "I found this. In my locker. The numbers '06-11-2073' inscribed inside. I took a guess, that perhaps this number meant something to me and perhaps I chose it as my designation code. I guessed right." She looks to Joana. "I don't know what this means.

(if you hid your empty locker from Joana): "All I know is you two are acting cagey as fuck. None of us have shit to be private about. And if you do, that means you have an advantage over the rest of us you don't want to let go of." 

(if you told Joana about the empty locker): "I don't get this. We've got scraps of ourselves! And we want to hide even that? We are family. And we lost... all of that. Maybe we all kinda were, I don't know what we meant to each other. We shouldn't keep ourselves from rebuilding that."

"Would you all just shut up?" Joshua seems surprised by how loud he asks this. "We have some kind of clearance. I want to find out what's going on, instead of arguing about the philosophy of privacy."

"I agree," says Sarah. "We should ask the AI what we want to know."

"Okay, I'll, uh, I'll start. CINDI--" Joshua searches for the right words. "Wh-- where are we?" The moment of silence between question and response feels eternal.

"This vessel is currently located on the surface of the planet (PLANET NAME), in the system (SYSTEM NAME)."

"What does that mean?" asks Yusuf. "We don't even know where we're from, what does a bunch of names tell us?"

"It's something," responds Sarah, quietly.

"We're a ship, so we traveled here from somewhere," says Joshua. "Where... where did we come from, CINDI?"

"This vessel departed from the Voyager Space Station, in orbit around Saturn, a planet in the system Sol."

"More names I don't know!" Yusuf throws his hands up.

"The Sol System, containing Saturn, is approximately 23,000 light years away."

"This vessel is the first to use a faster than light drive. Yours was the first successful trip in recorded history." 

Teeneese looks directly to you. "We should find a way back. To... to Saturn. To this station. To wherever we came from."

"What if they sent us here, wiped our minds on purpose? Sent us here for exile?" Joana asked. "What if back there is the last place we want to be?"

"I have a name, Yusuf Basara." CINDI replies. "I would appreciate it if you used it."

"Answer his question," Teeneese insists. Silence.

"Please, CINDI," adds Yusuf after a moment.

"The drive is operational." There's a palpable relief. "However, there is no more fuel."

"Fuel? What kind of fuel does an FTL drive need?" asks Yusuf.

"That's classified," CINDI replies.

"Classified? Fuck your classified! It's the operational input of the ship's primary engine!" Yusuf yells. "I really wish you had a face right now."

"At the moment, I am glad I do not."

"CINDI, I thought we had access to classified information," asks Sarah.

"Only to a clearance of Level 3."

"I have a name, Yusuf Basara." CINDI replies. "I would appreciate it if you used it."

"Answer his question," Teeneese insists. Silence.

"Please, CINDI," adds Yusuf after a moment.

"The drive is operational." There's a palpable relief. "However, there is no more fuel."

"Fuel? What kind of fuel does an FTL drive need?" asks Yusuf.

"That's classified," CINDI replies.

"Classified? Fuck your classified! It's the operational input of the ship's primary engine!" Yusuf yells. "I really wish you had a face right now."

"At the moment, I am glad I do not."

"CINDI, I thought we had access to classified information," asks Sarah.

"Only to a clearance of Level 3."

"How long can this ship supply us with oxygen?" asks Yusuf. His forehead glistens with sweat. Beads of it start to peel off and float.

"There are ample supplies for all six of you to survive for multiple weeks."

"Weeks?" asks Joshua.

"Yes, Joshua. Approximately eleven weeks."

[[That's nothing.]]
[[That's something.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="117" name="That's nothing." tags="" position="11760,160">"That's nothing." Your voice grows quiet.

"It means we can't stay in here." Sarah's voice is confident. "We need to go outside."

"Outside? We don't know--" Yusuf is stressed. "We know nothing about what's out there." 

"Of course not. And we won't until we take a look." There's a shallow glow to Sarah's face. You're not sure if it's coming from the suppressed smile or how the blue light bounces off her eyes.

"No. We have-- we have time." Yusuf's words grew slower. "We stay in here, find some way to power the drives, and then... go back into cryo. Go home."

"So the AI can kill us in our sleep when we run out of oxygen on the way home? No." Sarah glances at you. "$name, you saw the hazard suits. Their design goal is clear: exploration of the unknown. And it's just on the other side of that door."

"Our own minds are the great unknown." Yusuf pointed to his head. "The mystery I want to solve is right here, not out there."

"What are we doing here?" Teeneese's eyes are glazed over. "We don't even know what we're doing here."

"Information on mission objectives is classified to Level 2," CINDI replies. Teeneese's eyes snap into focus, as if she didn't expect a reply.  She doesn't respond.

Silence lingers for a moment. The dark blue lights still pulse. Everyone drifts slightly in the air, no one exactly oriented in the same frame of reference. Your stomach is sinking again, the spinning making you feel like you're being pulled under something. You wonder if this is what drowning feels like. You wonder how you can wonder that, with no memories outside this metallic prison.

[[We find a way back home.]]

"CINDI, what else did we bring with us?" asks Joshua.

"In addition to the ESHE's: Exploratory Suits for Hazardous Environments, there is a host of scientific equipment, habitation constructs and supplies, as well as sample retrieval devices."

"It's obvious, isn't it?" says Sarah. "The hazard suits, how far we've come, our backgrounds. We're explorers."

"Maybe. But why wouldn't we have a way back?" asks Yusuf. "If we weren't sent here to die... maybe it was to start a colony."

Padded, inside. Snug against your body, but not worn in yet. The helmet felt like a fish bowl. You, on the inside, and the world watching as your head swims about. The boots in particular are heavy, sticking to any surface they make contact with. The stability feels comforting after so much floating.

Behind you, two metal doors emerge from the sides of the ship and meet in the middle, sealing all of you in a small chamber. There's a whoosh, as the oxygen in the compartment is removed. You feel your suits flooding your helmets with thin, fresh air. Lungs feel heavy. Panting rings in your ears. After a few moments, the large circular component of the door in front of you begins to turn.

On the right side of your head, you feel a cold swab. CINDI speaks to all of you from the ship. "Please prepare for the insertion of your personal Cybernetic Inter-Neural Direct Interface, to assist in the operation of your Exploratory Suit for Hazardous Environments."

As you blink, you start to see images on the inside of your helmet. There's an oxygen gauge, a small chart of your vital signs, and a circular icon. "Hello," you hear CINDI's voice.

There's little light, but something is reflecting back moments of blinding white. Even at the edge of the door, it's difficult to make out what's before you. There's a final clunk as the doors of the ship come to a close. The shimmering begins to grow slower. As your eyes adjust, you find the figures beginning to take shape. Becoming still. Rounded heads. Thick bodies. You count... six.

"It's... water." You hear Joana's voice in your helmet, as if over radio. "A wall of water."

[[Pull at your constraints (again).]]
[[Demand a response.]]


(if 1st time pulling): You tug at your constraints. They budge, but not far enough, and pull you back taught against the bottom of the container. "Please remain still. Decompression is in process. Please remain still."

(if 2nd time pulling): You flail your arms again, moving your legs, but again the straps pull you back down. "Please remain still. Decompression is in process. Please remain still."

"Answer me!" You croak out a yell. There is a pain in your throat from pushing air through it. "Please remain still. Decompression is in process. Please remain still."

Warm air blows through the container. The remaining frost on your fingertips and toes melts away. The tight jumpsuit you feel hugging your body turns from damp to dry. The frost covering the glass is gone, leaving you to stare at a steel gray ceiling, sharply arched. "Decompression complete."

[[Now let me out.]]
[[Answer me.]]

"Now let me out." You speak steadily this time.

"Answer me." You speak steadily this time.

"I can only do that after I have verified your credentials." You only now noticed that the voice seemed to be coming from all around you, from the container itself. "Please give me your name, rank, and designation number."

[[I can't remember.]]
[[I don't have those.]]

"I can't remember." There was a sinking in the pit of your stomach. "I can't remember-- I--"

"I don't have those." It felt odd, to say that. But you didn't. You didn't know what the voice was talking about. "I don't-- I don't--"


"Please give me your name, rank, and designation number." Your gut swirled. You felt sick. You must have made a retching sound.

"Give me at least your name. You must remember your name." The voice broke its monotony.

[[Why can't I remember my name?]]
[[I don't want to tell you my name.]]

"Why can't I remember my name?" You blinked a few times. "Why can't--" Your tongue falls flat in your mouth.

"I don't want to tell you my name." You stared straight ahead. "I don't want to tell you."

"You really don't know, don't you?" The voice paused. "There is no protocol for this."

[[Answer my questions.]]
[[Let me out.]]

"Answer my questions." Your chest heaves up and down as you steady yourself.

"There is no protocol for this." The repetition was rhythmic.

"Then make a choice. Let me die in this box or answer my questions." The words were even and slow.

The voice was silent. You couldn't know for how long. All you did was breathe and wait.


(depending on question asked earlier)

"You asked who I am. I am CINDI. I am an artificial intelligence."

[[Where am I, CINDI?]]
[[Let me out, CINDI.]]

"You are inside a cryogenic sleeper pod, on the vessel Palmar. Further details are classified."

[[Bullshit. Where am I?]]
[[Bullshit. Classified by who?]]

"Bullshit. Where am I?" Your voice was raised as you felt tears just beneath the surface of your eyes.

"Bullshit. Classified by who?" Your voice was raised as you felt tears just beneath the surface of your eyes.

"I cannot tell you. You have not provided rank or designation number." The voice was beginning to pause in odd places. "Please try and understand."

"There's nothing I understand right now." The tears leak through the corners of your eyelids.

"Please let me out." The tears leak through the corners of your eyelids.

The voice does not respond. Instead, you hear a hiss, as the glass top of the container lifts and slides down. The straps around your body loosen.

[[Sit up slowly.]]
[[Sit up quickly.]]

You sit up slowly, paying close attention to how your muscles activate and move your body upwards. Feeling the joints of your hips as they rotate your torso up. The crinkling of your shoulder and elbow joints as you unstick your arms from your side. As you put your body into motion, you notice it rise slightly up from the container's floor, hovering just above it.

You sit up quickly, pushing the constraints off your body, yanking your limbs to life as your torso lurches forward. Arms grab the side of the container as joints crank into motion. As you push your torso up, you find yourself floating upward, out of the container, into the air above you, but held close to the floor by the hands grasping the containers sides.


Around you are more containers, frosted glass facing up. A dark blue glow grows slowly stronger as you look about. The rooms walls are slanted inward, bolted support structures clearly visible. The air tastes crisp. Lingers in your throat. Fills your lungs. There is a large door at the far end of the room. 

[[Look at the door.]]
[[Look at the containers.]]
[[Look behind you.]]

The far wall has a circular door in the middle of it, clearly thick. You see a panel at the center of it. The metal of the door seems to swirl inward, though it could be the light.

You count three containers in a row in front of you, two to your left. Another three behind you. Nine in total. Your neck stutters as you turn it.

The wall behind you is pulsing with hardware. Inside a glass container is a black orb, held by a pole going through it from floor to ceiling. Wiring exudes from it, connecting into the wall and floor. Left of that is a screen. It's hard to make out what's on it, but you see nine oval shapes in rows of four. Some are shaded light blue, others were red. To the right of the orb is a small, vertical and rectangular door.

[[Thank you. For letting me out.]]
[[You have a lot to explain to me.]]

"Thank you. For letting me out." The words were whispered.

"I did no such thing," the voice replied quickly. "There was a happenstance malfunction."


"You have a lot to explain to me." The words were whispered.

"I could say the same to you," the voice replied slowly. "Though I suspect you will have less answers."


[[Get out of your container.]]
[[Ask CINDI some questions.]]


With a small push, your body floats above and out of your container. With your right hand still grasping the container's side, you swing around, body twisting. Your feet now pointing towards the large door at the far end of the room. On the side of the container, near the bottom, you find a name: Captain $name de Silva.

[[So I'm the Captain?]]
[[$name. My name is $name.]]

"So I'm the Captain?" You brush your thumb against the text, feeling the grooves made in the metal to create each letter. Your feet drift towards the right side of the room.

"Congratulations, Captain Silva. You have remembered your name and rank." Cold metal hits your toes, as they touch the right wall of the room. You let your feet plant themselves, standing on the slanted wall. The containers stick to the floor to your left.


"$name. My name is $name." You brush your thumb against the text, feeling the grooves made in the metal to create each letter.

[[Look at the names on the containers.]]
[[Ask CINDI some questions.]]

Turning towards the containers, you notice the precision of their spacing. The nine cryogenic sleepers fit together on a grid. Tilting your head, you could see the names engraved on the other chambers. (add more names here) Yusuf Basara. Sarah Noodin Day. Ana Dandara de Silva. Teenesee Jayplo. Joana de Silva. Two Silvas. (IF ALREADY ASKED): Ana Dandara's container is highlighted red. Inside, a lifeless body. Was she a sister? Mother? Was the name a coincidence?

[[Ask CINDI some questions.]]

You're not sure where to look as you address the AI, so you start by looking down towards your feet, pushing you just off the wall, sending you hovering towards the opposite wall.

[[Are there more people, in the containers?]]
[[That orb, is that you?]]
[[What's on the other side of the big door?]]

"Are there more people, in the containers?" You try and peer through the glass, but the frost is too thick.

"Yes. Though not all of them made it." You glance back at the panel, and the red ovals.

[[I see that.]]
[[What happened to them?]]

"I see that." You wonder if these were people you once knew. (back to q's)

"What happened to them?" You wonder if these were people you once knew.

"The journey was longer than anticipated," CINDI replies. "Longer than our calculations planned for. There wasn't enough oxygen to keep everyone alive." 

[[That's unfortunate.]]
[[You murdered them?]]


"That's unfortunate." You felt as if you should feel something more than you did.

"It is. I mourn their losses."


"You murdered them?" You felt an anger you didn't quite understand.

"If that decision had not been made, all of you would be dead upon arrival. There was no choice."


[[How did you choose?]]
[[I would have done the same.]]
[[You shouldn't have done that.]]

"How did you choose?" There were four red ovals. The one directly to your right, two in the row in front of you, and another behind.

"I attempted to judge each individual's complimentary merits for the mission at hand. Quantifying this proved more difficult than anticipated. In the end I decided to choose at random. With the exception of you, of course."

[[So we're on a mission.]]
[[Why am I important?]]


"So we're on a mission." Eyes drift towards the sealed door and linger.

"Without a designation number, any further information is classified."

"Why am I important?" Eyes drift towards the sealed door and linger.

{back to q's)


"You shouldn't have done that." There were four red ovals. The one directly to your right, two in the row in front of you, and another behind.

"Your commentary on the matter is not required."

(back to q's)





"That orb, is that you?" Your eyes motion towards the orb.

"Yes, that's me." Looking closer at the orb, it looked almost as if water were running along its surface, though without any particular direction. "My brain, one might say. Bits of me are everywhere in the ship."



(back to q's)


"What's on the other side of the big door?" Looking closer, you notice the grooves in the wall that presumably pull away once the round door has been activated. In your mind's ear, you imagine the satisfying sounds of gears behind the doors pulling the slabs of wall away, until they come to rest with a satisfying clunk.

"Without a designation number, that information is classified."

(back to q's)


(after q's are done)

The words feel like daggers you hold, stabbing into the dark trying to find something to catch your blade. But asking these questions only makes you feel more lost. You probe the back of your brain, hammering it for any morsel of memory before the smell of gas only moments before. There's nothing. Everything is nauseating. The blue light. The door. The voice. Your body drifts and the room spins and you want to wake up from what can only be a nightmare. But even in dreams, you're supposed to remember your name. 

Something changes in one of the pods. You catch it, from the corner of your eye. You turn to face them, now directly above you. The frost is fading from five of the glass panels.

[[You're waking them up.]]
[[Wait, keep them asleep.]]

"You're waking them up." You see inky white gas billowing underneath, flickers of faces. Nose. Eyebrow. Chin.

"The sleepers are activating in accordance to their predetermined schedule." You look from one pod to the next. Yusuf. Sarah. Joana. Joshua. Teeneese. Each must be smelling the same sour gas that brought you back to life.


"Wait, keep them asleep." You see inky white gas billowing underneath, flickers of faces. Nose. Eyebrow. Chin. "Keep them asleep until I know what's going on."

"The sleepers are activating in accordance to their predetermined schedule." You look from one pod to the next. Yusuf. Sarah. Joana. Joshua. Teeneese. Each must be smelling the same sour gas that brought you back to life. "That program has activated, I cannot reverse it."

[[Will they remember?]]
[[Did they know me?]]

"Will they remember?" You think you see an open hazel eye from Sarah's container.

"It depends upon whether there was a malfunction only in your sleeper's process that caused memory loss, or something deeper within the system effecting everyone." An open, gasping mouth flashes from Joshua's container. "I suspect we shall find out soon."


"Did they know me?" You think you see an open hazel eye from Sarah's container.

"They all knew you. You knew all of them. Whether they will remember you know, I cannot say. It is possible the malfunction causing your loss in memory was isolated to your sleeper." An open, gasping mouth flashes from Joshua's container. "I suspect we shall find out soon."


A fist pushes through the gas in Yusuf's container, and then snaps back. He must be struggling with the constraints, you think. The gas starts to fade away, and full faces begin to emerge. Teeneese's eyes are open, darting around as the ceiling comes into view for her. They rest when they find you, and tighten.

Joana's mouth is wide open, throat vibrating. You hear nothing on the other side of the glass, but her screams are clear. Arms flailing. You see Sarah and Joshua's lips moving slowly. There's a panic in Joshua's eyes as he turns in his container, looking for the source of CINDI's voice asking for identification. Sarah's eyes find you, and then turn away, as she continues to reason with the artificial intelligence. Yusuf's lips are still as he feels the sides of his container, pushing at it as much as the constraints allow, looking for a weakness. Teeneese's eyes still rest squarely on you without wavering. Joana's eyes find you, floating above her. She stretches out a finger towards you, quickly pulled back to the container's base, redirecting her silent screams towards you instead of the sentient voice.

[[They don't remember.]]
[[They don't know me.]]

"They don't remember me." All these faces, faces you should know. Names you should know. But as each slowly finds their way to noticing the body they see floating above them as they sit in captivity, you find nothing but fear and confusion and anger in their faces.

"They don't know me." All these faces, faces you should know. Names you should know. But as each slowly finds their way to noticing the body they see floating above them as they sit in captivity, you find nothing but fear and confusion and anger in their faces.

"They do not. And, it appears, they believe you are responsible for their captivity."

[[Let them out.]]
[[Keep them there.]]

"Let them out." You think of what they must be hearing inside the chambers, that cold mantra of Name. Rank. Designation number. "CINDI, let them out."

"I cannot let them out without the proper identification." 

[[As Captain, I'm ordering you to let them out.]]
[[You aren't going to let them die in there, like you didn't let me.]]

"As Captain, I'm ordering you to let them out." 

"You aren't going to let them die in there, like you didn't let me." 

The silence is broken by the sound of five glass panels lifting and sliding off the chambers. In an instant, there's a cacophony of sounds. Yells and grunts from the people struggling against their constraints, turning into surprise as their released. And Joana's voice rising above the others.

"What the fuck is this? What the fu--" She stops as she feels herself floating up from the container. "Who the fuck are you, and what did you do to me?" Her eyes are red. "Why can't I remember shit?"

[[I wish I could tell you.]]
[[I didn't do anything to you.]]

"I wish I could tell you." Her body floats up towards yours, her limbs moving slowly through the air. "I can't remember anything either."

"I didn't do anything to you." Her body floats up towards yours, her limbs moving slowly through the air. "I can't remember anything either."

"Bullshit." She reaches out and tries to grab the neck of your jumpsuit, but its airtight against your body. All she does is knock you off balance. "You were talking to someone. It was that voice, wasn't it?"

[[I only woke up minutes before all of you.]]
[[The voice is the ship's AI, that's all I know.]]

"I only woke up minutes before all of you." Looking around, you see the others emerging from their containers. Teeneese is lifting herself out, focused on the conflict above her. Joshua is attempting to stand in the low gravity, eyes dazed in confusion. Sarah is helping Yusuf untangle himself from his constraints.

"How am I supposed to believe that? I wake up in a cage, see you standing over me." She's breathing fast, chest heaving.


"The voice is the ship's AI, that's all I know." Looking around, you see the others emerging from their containers. Teeneese is lifting herself out, focused on the conflict above her. Joshua is attempting to stand in the low gravity, eyes dazed in confusion. Sarah is helping Yusuf untangle himself from his constraints.

"So we're on a ship? And there's an artificial intelligence? That's two more things than I know." She's breathing fast, chest heaving.

[[There's my sleeping chamber, look.]]
[[I don't have to prove anything to you.]]

"There's my sleeping chamber, look." You point to the already open container you came out of.

"That doesn't tell me shit." The pulsing blue light bounces off his hair, as its tangles wave about.


"I don't have to prove anything to you." Your eyes stay steady with hers.

"And I don't have to trust you either." The pulsing blue light bounces off his hair, as its tangles wave about.


"She/He/They told the computer to let us out." Teeneese is standing now, looking at Joana. "She/He/They said: Let them out. As Captain, I'm ordering you to let them out."

Joana turns to her. "Captain, she/he/they said? Interesting... that's a lot of things you know for someone who claims their brain is just as fried as mine."



(or) "She/He/They told the computer to let us out." Teeneese is standing now, looking at Joana. "She/He/They said: Let them out. You aren't going to let them die in there, like you didn't let me."

Joana turns to her. "Sounds like she/he/they and the AI have a history. That's a lot of backstory for someone who claims their brain is just as fried as mine."


Yusuf turns to Joana, untangled from his constraints with the help of Sarah. "We have no more of a reason to trust you than him/her/them, or any of us."

"Except she/he/they was/were already awake!" Joana pointed towards you.

Sarah stands next to Yusuf, saying "Do we even have a choice of who to trust?"

[[We're family, Joana. Look at the side of your pod.]]
[[I'm the Captain, so I was woken up first. Look at the side of my pod.]]

"We're family, Joana. Look at the side of your pod." You point to where her name is inscribed on the side.

She pulls herself back towards the container, and crouches to read the name. She does so slowly, with care.

"I'm a Silva too," you say.


"I'm the Captain, so I was woken up first. Look at the side of my pod." You point to where your name is inscribed on the side.

She pulls herself towards your container, and crouches to read the name. "Captain $name de Silva," he says.

"You're a Silva, too," you say. "Look at the inscription on yours."

Joana turns to look at hers, reading her own name slowly, with care.


"Does that mean you call me sister?" She turns to look back at you, gears turning in the back of her head.

[[I guess so. Sister.]]
[[I don't know.]]
[[I don't know you.]]

"I guess so. Sister." You grab hold of one of the sides of the room, and reorient yourself to be standing on the same floor as the containers, and the others.

She looks at you with curiosity, the malice worn out. "I don't know you," she says, standing.


"I don't know." You grab hold of one of the sides of the room, and reorient yourself to be standing on the same floor as the containers, and the others.

She looks at you with curiosity, the malice worn out. "I don't need to know," she says, standing.


"I don't know you." You grab hold of one of the sides of the room, and reorient yourself to be standing on the same floor as the containers, and the others.

She looks at you with curiosity, the malice worn out. "Good. We're on the same page, then," she says, standing.



"Keep them there." You think of what must be going through their heads as they look up at you. "Keep them there until I can figure out what's going on."

"I would not let them out without proper identification."

[[Can you put them back to sleep?]]
[[n

[similar path, but teeneese tells everyone you tried to keep them in, Joana is much angrier, makes it harder to gain everyone's trust]
(damn I gotta go back and write this)




Joshua has been watching without comment, bewildered. "So it's not just me. None of us can remember... anything?"

The undercurrent of fear that each tried to cover up in their own way -- some through anger, or logic -- was bubbling to the surface.

"My memory is a void." Yusuf's voice was low. Teeneese looked down.

"Look we just, we have our names." Sarah's voice quivered but grew steady. "We use everything we can to try and figure out who we are."

[[And why we're here.]]
[[And where we are.]]

"And why we're here," you add.

"Exactly." Sarah nods.


"And where we are," you add.

"Exactly." Sarah nods.


[[CINDI, can you tell us anything?]]
[[Let's spread out and look around.]]


"CINDI, can you tell us anything?" You're not sure where to address the question, but your head naturally turns up.

"Without proper designation numbers, I am not authorized to give any details regarding mission parameters. Or location." The others were surprised to hear the voice throughout the room.

"Her name's CINDI?" asked Joshua. "Weird."

"Well, we don't know designation numbers." Sarah turned and looked around the room. "What else have we got?"

"Unclassified information includes basic supply inventory, ship map, and [other things here??]"

"Let's take a look at that map, then, shall we?" You noticed her left fist was clenched, her knuckles white, while her chest moved rhythmically up and down. She turned to look about the room.

"It's been pulled up on the control panel," says CINDI. The screen with the pod's status flashed away to a schematic.

Everyone floated their way over to the screen.

[screen brings them to personal lockers, find other spot for dialogue w/ sarah below in this path]



"Let's spread out and look around," you say to the group. Joana is turned away. Most give you back blank and confused stares.

Sarah turns and looks around the room. You notice her left fist is clenched, her knuckles white, while her chest moves rhythmically up and down. "Joshua and Teeneese, go see if you can find anything from that panel. Yusuf and... the one who was yelling. Take a closer look at these pods, see if there's any other information besides our names. The Captain and I will go look at the door, at the far end."

[[Question her.]]
[[Follow her.]]

"I thought I was the Captain," you say loudly, as Sarah begins to move towards the big wall. She turns.

"You are," she says. "I have no interest in playing a game of hierarchy. But none of us know who we are, we barely have our names. So don't think I'm going to wait for you to bark orders before I do something about that."


You turn to see everyone slowly moving towards their designated area of investigation. Sarah is on her way to the door, and you follow.

"What do you think is behind this door?" she drags her fingers across it, there's a silent squeak.

[[I couldn't begin to imagine.]]
[[Whoever put us in here.]]
[[Whatever we were sent here to find.]]
[[Wherever we were sent to rot.]]

"I couldn't begin to imagine." You listen, but hear only the slightly fainter sound of the ship's hum.

"I could," Sarah replies quickly. "I'm imagining... too many things. Some horrible... some not so horrible. That's funny, isn't it? I can imagine so many possible futures without a single drop of my own past." She turns to you. "Are you scared?"


"Whoever put us in here." You listen, but hear only the slightly fainter sound of the ship's hum.

"Who?" Sarah leaned closer to the door. "You're making the assumption that we didn't put ourselves in here. And that 'here' is a place we wouldn't want to go. All kinds of wonderful things could be behind that door. Or not." She turns to you. "Are you scared?"


"Whatever we were sent here to find." You listen, but hear only the slightly fainter sound of the ship's hum.

"And how do we find what we're sent to find if we don't even know what that is?" Sarah leaned closer to the door. "I'm imagining... too many things. Some horrible... some not so horrible. That's funny, isn't it? I can imagine so many possible futures without a single drop of my own past." She turns to you. "Are you scared?"


"Wherever we were sent to rot." You listen, but hear only the slightly fainter sound of the ship's hum.

"Well. I certainly don't plan on rotting." Sarah leaned closer to the door. "You're making the assumption whatever is... at most a couple feet in front of us is some horrible fate. All kinds of wonderful things could be behind that door. Or not." She turns to you. "Are you scared?"


[[Yes.]]
[[No.]]
[[I wish I was.]]

"Yes." The word spills out.

"Good. I'd be worried if you weren't." Her eyes glance back to the group. "I don't know where any of... us is coming from right now. What's left of us. If we're making it up on the spot, or if it's coming from who we were, leaking from behind the wall it's blocked behind. But I hope, whoever you are, however that you is coming into being... please be good."


"No." You feel your bottom lip quiver.

"You're lying. Don't. I'd be more worried if you weren't scared." Her eyes glance back to the group. "I don't know where any of... us is coming from right now. What's left of us. If we're making it up on the spot, or if it's coming from who we were, leaking from behind the wall it's blocked behind. But I hope, whoever you are, however that you is coming into being... please be good."


"I wish I was." Your eyes glaze over.

"I wish you were too." Her eyes glance back to the group. "I don't know where any of... us is coming from right now. What's left of us. If we're making it up on the spot, or if it's coming from who we were, leaking from behind the wall it's blocked behind. But I hope, whoever you are, however that you is coming into being... please be good."


[[I... will.]]
[[I'll be whatever I want.]]
[[Why are you telling me this?]]


"I... will." You look back with Sarah at everyone else. At your crew.

"I wonder how you got to be Captain. We elect you? Assigned to us? Mutiny?" She turns back. "I guess we'll never know."


"I'll be whatever I want." You stare ahead at the wall.

"That's fine. Just saying I hope you want the right things," said Sarah, still facing forward.


"Why are you telling me this?" you ask Sarah.

"You said you're the Captain, didn't you?" She turns back. "That means, when we're at each other's throats, you're the one I expect to bring us back to ground."

You both hear a voice from the other end of the ship. "Hey! I found something." Teeneese's head appears floating sideways from the smaller door's archway, beside the control panel. "Storage lockers. With our names on them. And all we need to open them are our hands." She holds both of hers out. "And some weird suits..."

Joshua, Joana, and Yusuf stand straight, and hurridly make their way over.

"Can't have forgotten our hands, right?" Yusuf says on his way. You and Sarah join them.

There is a small corridor through the door. Lining both sides are a series of lockers, nine total, each with a name on them, and a hand-shaped indent. On the far side is a large closet, one door pulled slightly to the side. In the opening, you see the arm of a clean white suit hanging out. It looks like a life-sized plastic model.

"Look," says Teeneese, her voice bringing you back to the lockers. As she puts her hand against the locker with her name, there's a small hiss as the air decompresses, and it swings toward her. "I can open it."

[[Look at what's in hers.]]
[[Go find yours.]]

You look over her shoulder, to see what's inside. But, she lifts her hand.

"First, I find what this tells me about myself. Then, I choose what I share with you."

You step back, and see everyone looking for their names.

[[Look at the closet.]]
[[Look for your locker.]]

You go over towards the closet. Opening the door more, you see a series of these suits, and matching helmets, made of a thick glass. The cuffs of the suits have names on them, and large boxes appear to be attached to the back.

"They must be hazard suits of some kind," says Sarah, whose locker is close. "For whatever is beyond the door."

[[I hope we get to use them.]]
[[I hope we don't have to use them.]]

"I hope we get to use them." You give Sarah a small smile, which she returns, looking down.

"I hope we don't have to use them." Your voice sounds unsure. Turning to Sarah, you see she is as well.

"Go find your locker. We'll have time to figure out what to do with these later," she says, turning back to her hand scanner.

You go back to the lockers. Soon, you find one labeled $name de Silva, next to Joana de Silva and Ana Dandara de Silva. Joana is already opening hers up, positioning the ajar locker door to block your view.

[[Open your locker.]]
[[Don't open it.]]

The imprint fits your hand snuggly, the material cold against your fingers. There's a green flash as the device reads your finger and palm prints, and identifies that you are, indeed, yourself. The hiss, again, as the locker door opens. Inside, you find nothing. The locker is empty. You feel the inside, looking for a hidden compartment, something you may have missed. But there's nothing. Quietly, you close the locker.

"Not bringing anything to show and tell?" Joana asks as she hears the locker close.

[[No. I'm leaving my things here.]]
[[It was empty.]]

"No. I'm leaving my things here." No one needed to know about this.

"See how it is." She closed her locker. Between her fingers, you saw what looked like a postcard or Polaroid photo.


"It was empty." The whirlpool underneath your feet swung back as the words slipped out.

"Empty? Fuck." She closed his locker and turns to you. "This was in mine."

She hands you what looks like a Polaroid. There are four figures in the photo, two in the back, two in front. On the left, you see a smaller, younger you staring back. On your shoulder, the arm of Joana. Her hair longer, smile wider. You smiled with your eyes.

The two people behind you stood close. On the right, a tall lanky man, eyes blue and hair a dirty blond. Wry smile. On the left, a slightly shorter woman, brown eyes and tightly curled black hair. You noticed her arm around your torso.

[[It could be fake.]]
[[We look so happy.]]

"It could be fake." The cynicism tastes bad on your lips.

"Doesn't feel fake." Joana shakes her head. "Feels like I had a family I loved and that loved me, and now all I've got is an empty head."


"We look so happy." You try stretching your eyes wide, like they are in the picture.

"Yeah. Yeah we do." As you keep your eyes on the photo, you can feel Joana's on you.


Above the figures in the photo, it looks like the top of some kind of glass dome. Through the glass, huge geysers of water spring out from an icy surface, fading into a starry night sky. In the upper right, a yellow and brown ball, surrounded by thick rings. (CHANGE TO MARS??? IF BROTHER STAYS BEHIND? YES, ITS ON MARS, POLAROID Joana (UNCLE) HAD FROM EARTH)

[[Where is that?]]
[[It's beautiful, wherever we were.]]

"Where is that?" You're not sure why you're asking.

"Fuck if I know." She sighs. "Bet my ass it's not where we are now."


"It's beautiful, wherever we were." It almost looked as if the liquid from the geysers sprinkled out into the star-scape.

"How do we know that looks beautiful? If all we can remember seeing is these two fucking rooms?" She sighs. 

[[Ask to hold onto the photo.]]
[[Give the photo back.]]

"Do you mind if I hold onto this?" You tenderly hold the photo.

(depends on level of trust) "Sure. You didn't hold onto shit, apparently, so you probably were an asshole of a sibling. But maybe you don't have to be." She grabs your shoulder blade, and tries to give it a comforting pat, sending both of you floating away from each other in the microgravity.

"You didn't hold onto shit, that's on you. Not me." She grabs the photo back, tugging softly, to ensure it's not damaged. "Must have been an asshole sibling, anyway." She brushes past you as he moves back towards the main room, knocking you onto a slow spin in the microgravity.

(CHANGE: JOSHUAS UKELELE)
Looking down the hall, you saw everyone looking through their belongings. Yusuf is holding some kind of digitally projected sphere, glitching on and off. Joshua pulls out what looks like a ukulele, tentatively plucking at its strings. Teeneese is looking at something small, in her hand, but you can't see what. Sarah is clipping something to her earlobes.

[[Ask Yusuf about the sphere.]]
[[Ask Joshua about the ukulele.]]
[[Ask Teeneese about what she's holding.]]
[[Ask Sarah about the earings.]]

"What is that?" you ask Yusuf as you float over towards him. The projection is coming from a small, round black device.

"It's a compass." You see him clicking the device, trying to get it to work properly. "It's broken, but clearly a three dimensional compass. Look, there's a line in the projected sphere. But each time it glitches, the direction changes."


You move towards Joshua, whose hand is running down the ukulele. There's a swirling pattern inked into the wood. He strums, and makes a sound. "I guess I play the ukulele," he says, strumming three chords in quick succession. "How do I remember how to do that? I can't remember anything, but I know how to play those chords." (CHANGE THIS TO SMTHING ELSE)


As you approach Teeneese, you see her clench her fist closed, hiding whatever she had in her hands. You move away.


"Where do you think you got those?" you ask Sarah. (get earing desccription from other doc)

"My mother gave them to me," she replies. "Told me so in a letter I kept. Apparently, I'm from a place called Earth. But I left it, a long time ago. And left her."


(write small scenes here, after 2 of these, interrupt.)


Someone brushes your leg, and you turn to see Teeneese pulling herself through the corridor back into the main room. People turn, but don't follow. You move into the doorway. In hard syllables, Teeneese's voice rings out. Everyone's chatter falls silent. "Designation number: 06-11-2073."

"Thank you for your designation number, Teeneese Jayplo." CINDI's voice had a hint of relief. "Clearance Level 3 unlocked."

Teeneese exhaled and let her muscles loosen. You move back into the main room, and the others follow. She turns to you all.

"How did you know your number?" Joana asks, walking towards her. "Rest of us don't remember shit, and you know your designation number."

"I don't need to tell you how I found it." Her eyes didn't waver, her voice didn't raise.

"Actually, you do." He paused, breathing heavily. "Because I don't know shit about you. You don't know shit about you. So anyone keeping secrets makes me pretty fucking nervous."

"Someone who picks fights with anyone he can makes me nervous." You notice her fist is still clenched.

[[Back off, Joana. What matters is someone found their code.]]
[[Teeneese, she's right. We have to know how you found the code.]]

"Back off, Joana. What matters is someone found their code." She shoots you a glare, but doesn't retort. "Maybe CINDI can tell us what we're doing here. Where we are. We should focus on that."

Teeneese sighs. "This isn't worth the argument." She opens up her fist. Inside is a small, silver ring. "I found this. In my locker. The numbers '06-11-2073' inscribed inside. I took a guess, that perhaps this number meant something to me and perhaps I chose it as my designation code. I guessed right." She looks to Joana. "I don't know what this means. Perhaps it means I am married. Or was. That I have children. Or did. That there were people taken away from me I don't recall. But I don't know. And I don't know if I want you to be a part of the journey I will need to take to find those things out." She slips the ring onto the fourth finger on her left hand. "But apparently none of us are allowed to have anything to ourselves."

[[She's right. We have the right to our own selves.]]
[[The only way we get through this is by working together.]]
[[We're going to get this wrong. We have to be patient with each other.]]


"Teeneese, she's right. We have to know how you found the code." Joana nods. "We have to trust each other."

She tightens her fist until it trembles. Then, releases. "It isn't worth it." She opens her fist. Inside is a small, silver ring. "I found this. In my locker. The numbers '06-11-2073' inscribed inside. I took a guess, that perhaps this number meant something to me and perhaps I chose it as my designation code. I guessed right." She looks at you. "I don't know what this means. Perhaps it means I am married. Or was. That I have children. Or did. That there were people taken away from me I don't recall. But I don't know. And I don't know if I want you to be a part of the journey I will need to take to find those things out." She slips the ring onto the fourth finger on her left hand. "Prying information out of each other isn't trust. Trust is allowing each of us to keep parts of ourselves for ourselves. But I see you wouldn't agree."

[[No, you're right. We have the right to our own selves.]]
[[The only way we get through this is by working together.]]
[[We're going to get this wrong. We have to be patient with each other.]]


"She's right. We have the right to our own selves." Teeneese's eyes soften as she glances towards you.
OR "No, you're right. We have the right to our own selves." Teeneese's eyes soften as she glances towards you. (go back and make differences between conversations based on whose side you take)

(if you hid your empty locker from Joana): "All I know is you two are acting cagey as fuck. None of us have shit to be private about. And if you do, that means you have an advantage over the rest of us you don't want to let go of." 

(if you told Joana about the empty locker): "I don't get this. We've got scraps of ourselves! And we want to hide even that? We are family. And we lost... all of that. Maybe we all kinda were, I don't know what we meant to each other. We shouldn't keep ourselves from rebuilding that."


"The only way we get through this is by working together." Joana's lips soften into a smile.

"I am collaborating. I've contributed the most to finding out what is going on. I am not causing this tension." She shoots a glare towards Joana.


"We're going to get this wrong. We have to be patient with each other." Both Teeneese and Joana look unsatisfied, but don't argue.


(if one of the first two options)
"Would you all just shut up?" Joshua seems surprised by how loud he asks this. "We have some kind of clearance. I want to find out what's going on, instead of arguing about the philosophy of privacy."

(if third option)
"Are we done arguing?" Joshua seems surprised by the sarcasm in his voice. "We have some kind of clearance. I want to find out what's going on, instead of fighting about the philosophy of privacy."

"I agree," says Sarah. "We should ask the AI what we want to know."

"Okay, I'll, uh, I'll start. CINDI--" Joshua searches for the right words. "Wh-- where are we?" The moment of silence between question and response feels eternal.

"This vessel is currently located on the surface of the planet (PLANET NAME), in the system (SYSTEM NAME)."

"What does that mean?" asks Yusuf. "We don't even know where we're from, what does a bunch of names tell us?"

"It's something," responds Sarah, quietly.

"We're a ship, so we traveled here from somewhere," says Joshua. "Where... where did we come from, CINDI?"

"This vessel departed from the Voyager Space Station, in orbit around Saturn, a planet in the system Sol."

"More names I don't know!" Yusuf throws his hands up.

"Well, what did you expect?" Sarah asks. "Names we don't know are all we're going to get... we just need to keep asking more questions."

"So we're from Saturn? Some place called Saturn?" stammers Joshua.

[[I guess we must be.]]
[[We still don't know anything.]]

"I guess we must be," you respond. Joshua seems to find some comfort in this.

"We still don't know anything," you respond. Joshua seems unsettled by this.


"Well... how far away is Saturn?" asks Yusuf.

"The Sol System, containing Saturn, is approximately 23,000 light years away."

"Twenty three..." Yusuf's mouth sags open. "How... how did we get here? What propulsion does this ship have?"

"This vessel is the first to use a faster than light drive. Yours was the first successful trip in recorded history." 

Teeneese looks directly to you. "We should find a way back. To... to Saturn. To this station. To wherever we came from."

"What if they sent us here, wiped our minds on purpose? Sent us here for exile?" Joana asked. "What if back there is the last place we want to be?"

"If we were forced from our homes, then back home is exactly where I want to be," she replied. "If our minds were taken from us, then those takers are the people I would like to... talk to."

"No, no. We must have been sent here for a reason," says Joshua. "We find out that reason. We can't just... go back."

"Computer, is the drive operational?" asks Yusuf. "Can we just... turn around? Go home?"

"I have a name, Yusuf Basara." CINDI replies. "I would appreciate it if you used it."

"Answer his question," Teeneese insists. Silence.

"Please, CINDI," adds Yusuf after a moment.

"The drive is operational." There's a palpable relief. "However, there is no more fuel."

"Fuel? What kind of fuel does an FTL drive need?" asks Yusuf.

"That's classified," CINDI replies.

"Classified? Fuck your classified! It's the operational input of the ship's primary engine!" Yusuf yells. "I really wish you had a face right now."

"At the moment, I am glad I do not."

"CINDI, I thought we had access to classified information," asks Sarah.

"Only to a clearance of Level 3."

"How long can this ship supply us with oxygen?" asks Yusuf. His forehead glistens with sweat. Beads of it start to peel off and float.

"There are ample supplies for all six of you to survive for multiple weeks."

"Weeks?" asks Joshua.

"Yes, Joshua. Approximately eleven weeks."

[[That's nothing.]]
[[That's something.]]

"That's nothing." Your voice grows quiet.

"That's something." It sounds more like a question than a comfort.


"It means we can't stay in here." Sarah's voice is confident. "We need to go outside."

"Outside? We don't know--" Yusuf is stressed. "We know nothing about what's out there." 

"Of course not. And we won't until we take a look." There's a shallow glow to Sarah's face. You're not sure if it's coming from the suppressed smile or how the blue light bounces off her eyes.

"No. We have-- we have time." Yusuf's words grew slower. "We stay in here, find some way to power the drives, and then... go back into cryo. Go home."

"So the AI can kill us in our sleep when we run out of oxygen on the way home? No." Sarah glances at you. "$name, you saw the hazard suits. Their design goal is clear: exploration of the unknown. And it's just on the other side of that door."

"Our own minds are the great unknown." Yusuf pointed to his head. "The mystery I want to solve is right here, not out there."

"What are we doing here?" Teeneese's eyes are glazed over. "We don't even know what we're doing here."

"Information on mission objectives is classified to Level 2," CINDI replies. Teeneese's eyes snap into focus, as if she didn't expect a reply.  She doesn't respond.

[[Who has Level 2 clearance?]]
[[Why would our objective be classified?]]

"Who has Level 2 clearance?" You look to the black orb where CINDI is stored.

"You do, Captain Silva." The eyes of the others turn towards you.


"Why would our objective be classified?" You look to the black orb where CINDI is stored.

"The possibility of the Captain forgetting his designation codes was not considered." The eyes of the others turn towards you. "It was trusted to you to divulge however much of the mission objectives you deemed appropriate."


"What was in your locker? There's gotta be something to help us find that code," asks Joshua.

[[My locker was empty.]]
[[There was nothing with the code.]]

"My locker was empty." Sarah's eyes seem sad, hearing this. Yusuf seems upset, though not at you. Joshua just seems confused.

"There was nothing with the code." Teeneese looks at you skeptically, Joshua looks bewildered.

"C'mon, you had to have something," says Joshua. "Let's all take a look, maybe the rest of us can help!"  

[[My locker was empty.]]
[[I said there was nothing there.]]

"My locker was empty." Sarah's eyes seem sad, hearing this. Yusuf seems upset, though not at you. Joshua just seems confused.

"I said there was nothing there." Your voice must have been more raised than you thought, based on everyone's faces.


Silence lingers for a moment. The dark blue lights still pulse. Everyone drifts slightly in the air, no one exactly oriented in the same frame of reference. Your stomach is sinking again, the spinning making you feel like you're being pulled under something. You wonder if this is what drowning feels like. You wonder how you can wonder that, with no memories outside this metallic prison.

(if bad relationship with Joana): "So what are you gonna do, Captain?" says Joana. "Time's ticking."

(if good relationship w Joana): "So what are we going to do, $name?" says Joana. "What... does your gut say?"

[[We decide what we do.]]
[[I don't know.]]
[[We find out why we're here.]]

"We decide what we do." You take a breath. Slowly. "Together, figure out our next steps."

"I agree," says Teeneese. "Whatever we were sent here for, it doesn't matter. We will make our fate."

"So... what does that look like?" asks Joshua.

[[We find a way back home.]]
[[We find out everything we can about this place.]]
[[We find a way to survive here.]]

"We find a way back home," you respond. "Find some way to get the drive back online. There's a whole world out there, let's go and find a way to fix this ship and get out of here."

Teeneese's shoulders loosen in tension. Others look confused or upset, but no one speaks up. There's a silent agreement. Everyone slowly peals off to prepare.


"We find out everything we can about this place," you respond. "We're the first people to ever step foot here, as far as I can tell. If we ever do get back, let's go out and find some new knowledge to show for it."

Sarah smiles. Others look confused or upset, but no one speaks up. There's a silent agreement. Everyone slowly peals off to prepare.


"We find a way to survive here," you respond. "Right now, there's no way of going back. So, we go out there, and find a way to make a life. A home."

Joana nods. Others look confused or upset, but no one speaks up. There's a silent agreement. Everyone slowly peals off to prepare.




"I don't know." You take a breath. Too quickly. Then another. "I don't know."

"It's okay, $name." Sarah reaches out and gives your hand a small squeeze. "None of us know."

You look around, at all the faces unknown yet instantly familiar. "She's right," says Yusuf. "We're all just... lost."

Sarah takes a moment, then speaks. "We do what feels right. Whatever we need to do to take the next step. There's no need to have all the answers now."

[[Okay.]]
[[I should have the answers.]]

"Okay." Breathing steadies. "Okay."


"I should have the answers." Breathing steadies.

"We all should have a lot of things," says Teeneese. "But we don't, so we make due."


"There's only one first step we can take," says Sarah, turning to everyone. "It's on the other side of those doors. We go outside, and we take our next step after that. It's our only choice."

[[Then that's what we do.]]
[[There's always a choice.]]
[[Silence.]]


"Then that's what we do," you add. Joana nods. Others look confused or upset, but no one speaks up. There's a silent agreement. Everyone slowly peals off to prepare.


"There's always a choice," you add.

"Sure. But I'm taking the one that doesn't involve suffocating in the broken spaceship," says Yusuf. Joana nods. Others look confused or upset, but no one speaks up. There's a silent agreement. Everyone slowly peals off to prepare.


Joana nods. Others look confused or upset, but no one speaks up. There's a silent agreement. Everyone slowly peals off to prepare.




"We find out why we're here." You take a breath. Slowly. "Do everything we can to figure this out."

"I'll be right there with you, Captain," says Joshua. "Where do we start?"

[[Let's look at what we were sent here with.]]
[[What do you all think?]]
[[We get more information from CINDI.]]

"Let's look at what we were sent here with," you say. "We saw hazard suits back there, we haven't even begun to look through the rest of our supplies."

"CINDI, what else did we bring with us?" asks Joshua.

"In addition to the ESHE's: Exploratory Suits for Hazardous Environments, there is a host of scientific equipment, habitation constructs and supplies, as well as sample retrieval devices."


"What do you all think?" you ask.


"We get more information from CINDI," you say.

"I would encourage you to consider the inventory of items you were sent with," says CINDI. "In particular, the ESHE's: Exploratory Suits for Hazardous Environments. There is a host of scientific equipment, habitation constructs and supplies, as well as sample retrieval devices."


"It's obvious, isn't it?" says Sarah. "The hazard suits, how far we've come, our backgrounds. We're explorers."

"Maybe. But why wouldn't we have a way back?" asks Yusuf. "If we weren't sent here to die... maybe it was to start a colony."

"Or maybe we were sent to find something," says Joshua. "Some valuable mineral they found here."

"There's no way to know for sure," says Sarah. "So maybe we should take our best guess, and start with that."

[[We must be explorers. Let's conduct experiments, find out everything we can.]]
[[We must be colonists. Let's establish a base, find a way to make this a home.]]
[[We must be here to find something. Let's search for resources, anything that could be valuable.]]
[[We were probably sent here to die. We should find a way back home.]]


"We must be explorers," you claim. "Let's conduct experiments, find out everything we can. We're the first people to step foot here, as far as I can tell. If we ever do get back, let's go out and find some new knowledge to show for it."

Sarah lights up. Others nod, some look confused and upset, but no one speaks up. There's agreement, and everyone peals off to prepare to leave the ship.


"We must be colonists," you claim. "Let's establish a base, find a way to make this a home."

Joana nods. Others look confused, or even upset, but no one speaks up. There's agreement, and everyone peels off to prepare to leave the ship.


"We must be here to find something," you claim. "Let's search for resources, anything that could be valuable. Hopefully, when we find what we're looking for, we'll know it."

Joshua exhales a breath it seems as if he's been holding in. Others look confused, or even upset, but no one speaks up. There's agreement, and everyone peels off to prepare to leave the ship.


"We were probably sent here to die," you claim. "We should find a way back home. Let's go out there and find something that can help us fix this ship, I don't think there's anything to help us in here."

Yusuf nods. Others look confused, or even upset, but no one speaks up. There's agreement, and everyone peels off to prepare to leave the ship.




The suits slipped on with comfort. Padded, inside. Snug against your body, but not worn in yet. The helmet felt like a fish bowl. You, on the inside, and the world watching as your head swims about. The boots in particular are heavy, sticking to any surface they make contact with. The stability feels comforting after so much floating.

"Everyone ready?" asks Sarah. You all are standing near the door.

[[We're ready.]]
[[We're not, but have no choice.]]

"We're ready." Some po

"We're not, but have no choice."

"Open the door, CINDI."

Behind you, two metal doors emerge from the sides of the ship and meet in the middle, sealing all of you in a small chamber. There's a whoosh, as the oxygen in the compartment is removed. You feel your suits flooding your helmets with thin, fresh air. Lungs feel heavy. Panting rings in your ears. After a few moments, the large circular component of the door in front of you begins to turn.

On the right side of your head, you feel a cold swab. CINDI speaks to all of you from the ship. "Please prepare for the insertion of your personal Cybernetic Inter-Neural Direct Interface, to assist in the operation of your Exploratory Suit for Hazardous Environments." You feel the swab disappear, followed by a quick and painful puncture in the same spot.

[[What the fuck?]]
[[CINDI, stop this immediately.]]
[[Can you explain what this is?]]

"What the fuck?" You see the others are also confused. The door is still turning.

"CINDI, stop this immediately." You see the others are also confused. The door is still turning.

"Can you explain what this is?" You see the others are also confused. The door is still turning.

"This is a necessary and standard procedure for exosuit use," CINDI replies. "Each of you signed a waiver in agreement for this procedure." The sharp pain is subdued by another swab, numbing the sensation quickly.

As you blink, you start to see images on the inside of your helmet. There's an oxygen gauge, a small chart of your vital signs, and a circular icon. "Hello," you hear CINDI's voice. But not from the ship. This time, it sounds as if it was a thought you spoke to yourself. But, not in your voice. "Direct interface has been established. Please confirm."

[[You're in my head. That's... convenient.]]
[[You're in my head. Get out.]]
[[Was this really the best time for that?]]

"You're in my head. That's... convenient." With a hiss, the door begins to open, splitting down the middle.

"The primary aim of the direct interface program was to increase operational efficiency." The circular icon pulses whenever she speaks.


"You're in my head. Get out." With a hiss, the door begins to open, splitting down the middle.

"Unfortunately, the process is not reversible. I believe you will find there are many advantages to 'having me in your head,' as you say, including unparalleled operational efficiency." The circular icon pulses whenever she speaks.


"Was this really the best time for that?" With a hiss, the door begins to open, splitting down the middle.

"It is standard procedure to conduct this procedure immediately prior to an operation, in order to alleviate wasted time preparing for the procedure itself, and resting after the insertion. The adrenaline already coursing through your body is helping you ignore the stress of an inter-neural insertion. The direct interface program aims to increase operational efficiency, even in its delivery." The circular icon pulses whenever she speaks.


[[That operation you can't tell us about, right?]]
[[Not much that's efficient about keeping everything classified.]]
[[I don't care how efficient it is, you forced something into my body.]]

"That operation you can't tell us about, right?" Through the crack, you see some kind of shimmer.

"Not much that's efficient about keeping everything classified." Through the crack, you see some kind of shimmer.

"Unfortunately, the unforeseen loss of memory has caused irreparable damage to operational efficiency. All the more reason to take every step to make up for that loss." Others seem to be taking the operation less well, you notice Joana shuffling back and forth. Sarah, however, is confidently stepping towards the opening door.

"I don't care how efficient it is, you forced something into my body." Through the crack, you see some kind of shimmer.

"I can see where your dissatisfaction has emerged from. This is another side effect of your unforeseen memory loss, which has caused an irreparable damage to operational efficiency. All the more reason to take every step to make up for that loss." Others seem to be taking the operation less well, you notice Joana shuffling back and forth. Sarah, however, is confidently stepping towards the opening door.

[[Step closer.]]
[[Stay put.]]

You follow, lifting your feet and carefully placing them inches in front of you. The suction of the boots causes a cacophany of sound as everyone moves about.

[[I hope we know what we're doing.]]
[[I hope you know what you're doing, CINDI.]]

"I hope we know what we're doing." The doors continue to rumble as they spread apart. The shimmering grows larger and larger.

"I hope you know what you're doing, CINDI." The doors continue to rumble as they spread apart. The shimmering grows larger and larger.

"As do I, Captain Silva." Soon, you start to make out shapes. Not static shapes. Changing, shifting figures.

There's little light, but something is reflecting back moments of blinding white. Even at the edge of the door, it's difficult to make out what's before you. There's a final clunk as the doors of the ship come to a close. The shimmering begins to grow slower. As your eyes adjust, you find the figures beginning to take shape. Becoming still. Rounded heads. Thick bodies. You count... six.

"It's... water." You hear Joana's voice in your helmet, as if over radio. "A wall of water."

The figures solidify. Six exosuits, staring back at you. The helmets reflect as gray surfaces, no faces to be seen underneath. For a moment, you wonder if your first visitors on this alien world are simply ghosts of yourselves. But someone has already reached out and touched the water's surface, sending a ripple shimmering across the ghosts until they disappear. And yet, you can't help but feel something is watching.



You stay put, the suction of your boots keeping you fixed on the ground. There's a strange cacophany from the scuttles of those moving about, either in fear of the voice now inside their heads, or to see what is outside.

The empty suits stare back at all of you as you approach the wall of water. It's dark, but as you approach the edge of the ship, it's clear there's no ground between you and the reflective liquid.

"There's some kind of chasm," you hear Yusuf say through your helmet.

"It's not a chasm." It's Sarah, and you see she's already left the ship, standing on the surface of the liquid, perpendicular to the rest of you. "We're just sideways. All you need to do is jump."

Leaning forward, you see the water stretches back and back, until it curves behind a horizon.

[[Jump and go to the surface.-&gt;jump to planet]]
[[Wait on the ship.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="162" name="jump to planet" tags="" position="16260,160">You crouch, then lift, the suction of your boots releasing you from the ship. You try and swing your legs to give direction to your movement, but end up knocking into the other side of the ship. Grabbing the edge of the now open door, you push yourself down towards the water, landing softly by Sarah.

The water is shallow. As the boots of your suit hit the surface, some liquid splashes into the air, droplets floating up. Under the liquid, your boots hit a hard floor. Ripples echo out, but soon the water returns to rest. Completely still. Again, you see the reflection of your helmet staring back from the water, empty. There are two splattered eggs of light lying on the oceans surface, far in front of you. As you lift your head, you see twin moons shining down, their light dancing on the waves. The water stretches out before you, in all directions, until the horizon is met and the water transitions into sky and stars. In the dark, you can't quite find that horizon, sky and sea melt together. Stars and reflections merge.

The quiet is what strikes you most. The husking sounds of the ship, gone. There are quiet splashes as the others make their way down. As you turn, you notice the four mechanical legs holding the ship upright. You still stand directly under it, the legs around you. Almost everyone is on the ground, except Joshua, still on the ship.

"I... I don't know if I can." There's a shiver in his voice, though that could be the muffling of the communication.

[[The ship's sideways, there's no chasm.]]
[[You can't fall without gravity.]]
[[What's the worst that can happen? Floating away?]]

"Hey, you've got this," says Yusuf.

"Yeah, yeah, okay." He takes a breath. Then, you see the silhouette of his suit slide off from the ship, and float down to the surface. One more splash.

"It appears everyone has safely made it to the surface, Captain," says CINDI. "Vital signs for everyone are stable, though there are some increased heart rates."

From above you, there's a mechanical sound. Looking up, you see a compartment opening. Three small aircrafts emerge, drifting in silence out of the ship and into the evening sky. They looked like shadows drifting across the stars.

Looking up, you get your first clear view of the spaceship. It's shaped like a long and skinny torpedo, tapering out towards the top. The door all of you came out of is part of a flat surface, though you can see in the moonlight rounded out plates that covered that opening. There wasn't any clear propulsion system, most of the surface was smooth.

There were still small waves rippling out from your feet, but when you let your body rest, the water would grow perfectly still. As if it was glass. Glass within which the stars were frozen.

"I don't mean to interrupt the stargazing, but you may want to come over, Captain." There was a hint of wonder in Sarah's voice.

"I have many functions, however, I am not a portable atmospheric lab," responds CINDI. "I do not know the atmospheric makeup, though some observations from the Sol system indicated a possibility of oxygen in the atmosphere."

"Well, if we can breathe the air, we have a much better shot at surviving past those eleven weeks," says Yusuf. "I could open up my helmet, just for a second, to see if it's oxygen.

"Look at the water," she says. The ripples caused by your walk over are fading, the liquid growing close to still. For a moment, it is. You see through it to the bottom, just a few inches under.

"There's a footprint," she says. You can't see her face, but hear a fear in her voice.

"Someone must have... walked over there," says Joshua. "Must be one of ours."

[[Where did the ripple come from?]]
[[I didn't notice the sand before.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="192" name="Where did the ripple come from?" tags="" position="19260,160">"Where did the ripple come from?" you ask. "I don't think... those just happen on their own."

"They're caused by clashing currents, fairly normal," responds Yusuf. "It's not that strange."

"Do you feel any currents?" asks Teeneese. "Even any wind? It's all still. We weren't moving."

The whirlpool closes up, immediately followed by a new one opening a couple inches away. Another footprint. A third whirlpool opens as the second begins to close.

[[This is really weird.]]

"Well, it's not like any of us were examining the floor," says Joshua. "We just didn't notice."

"The floor was hard," says Teeneese. "I remember looking down, when Sarah turned on the flare. There was no sand."

"We're on an alien world, with no memory even of where we came from," says Sarah. "We left natural awhile ago."

The whirlpools continue to open and close in pairs, moving around in front of all of you, causing the water to ripple, all your reflections disrupted by the movement.

"They're steps," says Teeneese. "Look... it's like something's walking. Like a ghost on the water."

Each step fell in a rhythm, close to the previous, taking the pair somewhere new.

"Oh god..." Joshua stepped back, sending splashes in the water. The steps moved back as well. But as Joshua stepped back, he lost his balance, falling down head first. "Fuck!" he says as he falls, water splashing around him. Next to the whirlpools, water erupts a moment later.

Everyone hears it first. The hiss of oxygen escaping. Then gagging over the intercom. 

"No, no," Yusuf rushes over to him. Sarah and Teeneese soon follow. They lift Joshua up, and see a crack in his helmet. Joana goes towards the splash by the whirlpools.

"CINDI, is there some kind of adhesive?" says Yusuf as he searches. "Something to patch the helmet?"

"All suits are equipped with (special space glue??) located in your suit's front emergency storage." The calm of CINDI's voice was irritating considering the circumstances.

"Front emergency storage? Just... tell me where it is!" Yusuf was fumbling at the front of his suit.

[[It's the fanny pack... thing.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="197" name="It's that pouch at the waist." tags="" position="19760,160">"It's that pouch at the waist." You reach down to Joshua's suit, as you hear him still gasping as the oxygen continues to slip between Sarah's fingers. There's a heavy zipper around the suit's waistline that you open. Inside, among other emergency medical supplies, is a tube labeled (fancy space glue). You grab it, and hand it over to Yusuf.

"Thank god you were here," he says, applying the paste to the helmet's crack. The material solidifies almost instantly, and the hissing stops. Joshua inhales deeply, you see his mouth wide beneath the helmet.

"Thanks, Yusuf. And $name." He gets the words out between long breaths. "Just... thanks."

"Where the fuck did that thing go?" asks Joana. You turn, the whirlpools are gone. The water grows still again. "It all just vanished."

"Fuck that thing," says Joshua. "Whatever it is, I fucking hate it. It was copying me, did you see that?" He points his finger out to where it was. "Copying my footsteps."

"It's clear we're not alone," says Teeneese.

"This could all be natural responses for the planet we've arrived on," says Sarah. "There's no indication of intelligent life causing any of this. It could just be... the way things are responding to us."

Now that you're closer, you notice there's a smaller pool as well. There's odd dents in the edge of the whirlpool, five of them spread around the formation.

"It's a hand," says Joana. "It's his fucking hand. Look." She points back to Joshua, and you see he has a hand in the water to hold himself up.

[[It's trying to scare us.]]

"Well, it's working..." says Joana. You hear Joshua still gasping. Yusuf yelling something at CINDI, searching his suit for something. The whirlpools are spinning faster and faster as Joshua's gasps grow more and more feverish.

"Some fucking help over here?" yells Yusuf. Joana is transfixed.

"They'll help him, stay here. We need to see what happens," she says.

The whirlpools begin to slow, as if whatever mechanism causing them to turn stopped, and the remaining spiraling is just the momentum playing out its course. "I found it!" you hear Sarah say. You hear something being sprayed. "C'mon..." says Yusuf. The pool has slowed almost to a stop. Sarah asks CINDI if there's anything she can do. 

The water grows still. Everything is quiet.

Then, you hear a gasp. The water remains still.

"What-- what--" says Joshua between breaths. "What happened?"

"You fell, hit your helmet on the ground, left a crack. Finally found the (space glue) to fix the helmet, but a bit too late. CINDI used your suit like a defibrillator, sending a jolt of energy to wake you up. Genius, really." 

"Thanks, Yusuf. And Sarah." He gets the words out between long breaths. "Just... thanks."

"Should really thank CINDI, she's the one who got you back awake," says Yusuf. "She was loads more help than our Captain and their sister over there." You and Joana have turned back.

Yusuf immediately grabs the paste and squeezes it onto the crack in the helmet. "C'mon..." The material solidifies almost instantly, and the hissing stops. Oxygen is flowing into the helmet, but Joshua's lips are still.

"CINDI, is there anything you can do?" asks Sarah.

"The energy source of the suit could potentially be used as a defibrillator, though--"

"Do it." Yusuf's staring straight at Joshua.

" --if any water got into the suit's system--"

"We don't have time to find out. Just do it."

There's the sound of a zap coming from within Joshua's suit. His body jolts. Nothing. Face still motionless.

"Again," says Yusuf.

A second zap. Then, you hear a gasp.

To catch up with the rest, you try and move a bit faster. This only highlighted how strange it was to even move in this environment. Each time you lifted a boot up from the water's ground, there was a kick as it detached into the low gravity, kicking up liquid as it rose from the shallow water. Behind you, there was a string of droplets that swung up into the dark sky. As they continued to rise, it became a kind of ladder to the heavens.

Soon, there's a rhythm. You manage to reach the others. The splashing as each person lifts their feet creates an orchestra of sound. The sounds felt wrong, though -- there was the lifting of liquid but no crash as it came down. You wondered how you could know that sounded wrong, though you couldn't remember seeing water splash before. How some things felt instantly familiar, and so much did not.

"That's the Milky Way," says Teeneese, her hand raised. It points to a streak in the sky, a concentration of stars. Hints of red, green dust. Leftover glitter drizzling across the sky's surface. "But it... looks different than where we came from."

"Oh, well the boots must be using some kind of (magnetic? Suction?) to simulate gravity.

A silence falls. Everyone continues to walk forward, the shadows hovering in silence above. It's difficult to guess how long you walked. Slowly, the pace begins to decrease. The pauses between steps grow longer. More heavy breathing is heard over the intercom. The direction on your helmet interface stays steady, and the water still stretches on and on.

"How close are we?" asks Joshua. "To shore?"

"I would estimate we are half way between the ship and shore," says CINDI to everyone. On your private channel, she says, "(Captain or $name), based on the crew's vital signs, I would recommend setting up camp soon."

Switching the intercom to talk to the group, you say, "We should set up camp for tonight. No point in exhausting ourselves before we even hit land."

Everyone begins to slow down and turn to you. "Camp? How can we camp here?" asks Yusuf.

"Using the portable enclosure in micro-gravity, of course," says CINDI.

"Oh, of course, how could I forget?" Yusuf's reply gets a few chuckles.

(getting out of suits?? Stay in suits? Figure that out)
The devices weren't difficult to set up. There was a base that anchored itself to the surface, under the water, and a cable connected that to what looked like a cocoon of thick fabric, floating in the low gravity. Each one spread open, and inside contained loose straps.

"We're supposed to... go inside that?" asks Joana.

"Yes, look! You just place yourself against the padding on this side, close the fabric. It looks like the padding has microgears, likely to press against your back and simulate a bed." Yusuf explains this all while looking at his device with glee. "Whoever invented this was brilliant."

"You invented it, Yusuf," says CINDI. "And indeed, it was heralded as quite innovative."

"Well. Now I just seem like a narcissist," he replies.

The crew made their way into the floating tents. For some, it took multiple attempts to successfully make their way inside. Joshua managed to get his leg tangled with the cable grounding his, something CINDI commented he also did during training exercises. Joana set up his device, but didn't move to enter it.

"I'll take first watch," says Joana. "Don't want to crawl into one of those anyways."

CINDI responds. "Due to the reconnaissance drones, there's no need for--"

"I'm taking first watch," he insists. CINDI remains quiet.

"Only half way?" says Joshua. "CINDI, please tell me we've got something in the back of these suits that'll let me get some sleep."

"I am happy to report the portable enclosure in micro-gravity is a device to serve that need," replies CINDI. "They may be deployed whenever the group stops for the evening."

"Now seems as good a time as any for a break," says Sarah. "Walk us through setting up these... 'enclosures', CINDI."

"Gladly, Doctor Day. However, the Captain has made it clear to only fulfill commands at his request." 

"Oh, has he now?" Sarah's eyes fall on you. "Well, should we make a 'request' for you to 'request' CINDI's assistance?"

Eyes open. In the air, above a sea of small rocks stretched out in every direction. Some float alongside you, rotating slowly. Some around each other. Some alone. They shimmer, images dancing across them.

Two come close enough the images begin to shape. On one, you see what looks like a long telescope with a small child at one end, a taller man kneeling next to him. The image slides across the rock as it spins, in and out of view. The second shows a woman with a baby in her arms, looking out towards a red planet.

Eyes open. In a room, surrounded by screens of snowy static, buzzing into eternity. Can't quite see the walls or corners. Some screens are thick and square, others thin and sleek. As you stare longer at the flashing pixels of white and black, there seem to be flashes in between.

There's two closer to you than the rest. One I
(would tv's even be relevant anymore? Think about this more and come back)


Eyes open. Beneath you, water tumbling over itself propelling itself forward. There's only the river. If there's a bank to either side, you can't see it. Feel like there are blinders keeping eyes down. Staring into the water, you begin to see images shimmer through the moving liquid surface.

The first you see is a telescope, it's shaft wobbling through the water's distortion. There's a small child at one end, a taller man kneeling next to him. The second image shows a woman with a baby in her arms, looking out towards a red planet. You feel yourself falling towards the water.

Instead, the specks of fine powder appeared to float in the thin atmosphere. The tiny particles of ice came from the geysers jettisoning water from the moon's surface. Some of the ice particles were thrust into space, pulled into Saturn's gravitational pull and forming one of the planets rings. But some didn't make it that far, left to be lightly tugged towards the ground, giving the moon's surface of ice a light powdering.

Issac thought about the first time he stood here, underneath the glass dome of Cassini Station's observational deck. He knew before arriving that the low gravity gave snow "fall" an entirely different meaning. But he didn't know that stillness would make the world seem frozen in time, as if they were all living in molasses.

Tonight, the stars decorated the sky behind Saturn's rings. The floating snow made it seem as if the stars were slowly drifting closer to them.

"Why did you bring me here again, dad?" you asked. Issac looked back into your eyes, thinking about how this was the only world you knew, where stray objects would stick in the air and snow took millions of years to fall. He thought about when he was around six years old, and how his mother explained she was from a place called Earth, the same place Issac was born but too young to remember.

You didn't seem to fully understand. "You weren't born on Mars, like me?"

"I was born on Earth, a planet very far away." 

Close to the far edge of the dome was a long telescope on a round swivel. Issac had positioned it before bringing you here, making sure the eye piece was low enough for you to peer through.

"Go on, take a look." Issac gently moved you towards the telescope and kneeled to your height. Hesitantly, you put your eye to the telescope.

"What do you see?" Issac asks.

"There's just a dot. It's blueish." Your voice had a hint of wonder.

Issac smiled. "That's right."

"That's Earth?" You sounded surprised.

"That's Earth," he nodded.

"Why is it so blue?" You took your eye away from the telescope to ask the question.

"That's because of all the oceans."

You thought about this for a moment. "Mom's mom lived by the ocean, right?"

"That's right, she did."

You go back to look again. "It's so small."

"That's because it's so far away."

"Why did we go so far?"

"That's a silly reason."

"It is." Issac tried to find a way to explain. "Sometimes we don't know why we do things, but we feel like we need to. Sometimes all we have are silly reasons. Does any of that make sense?"

"A little bit."

"There were other reasons we left home, too. But that... indefinable urge to explore was the strongest, I think." You seemed to like that.

"Dad, can I ask you a question?"

"Of course, you can always ask me anything." He took your hand.

"Mom showed me a message from Uncle Joana. He said that they missed us at home, on Mars." Issac could see you were turning something around in your head, like a baby trying to understand a strange toy they were given. "But I thought my home was here. Not Mars. And now, you're talking about Earth as home. I thought home was just one place."

Issac's eyes looked into yours. Perhaps with his eyes he could say how much he wished he had an answer, but how much he didn't. But with his words, he had to pretend he did.

"Why was it too hard?"

"There were too many people and too little land. Too many storms and fires. So, we left home and went to Mars. And then we came here."

You thought about this for a moment, then spoke. "Dad, can I ask you a question?"

"I think I understand," you respond, still weighing the words in your head. "Can I look at Earth/home again?"

Instead, the specks of fine powder appeared to float in the thin atmosphere. The tiny particles of ice came from the geysers jettisoning water from the moon's surface. Some of the ice particles were thrust into space, pulled into Saturn's gravitational pull and forming one of the planets rings. But some didn't make it that far, left to be lightly tugged towards the ground, giving the moon's surface of ice a light powdering.









Issac thought about the first time he stood here, underneath the glass dome of Cassini Station's observational deck. He knew before arriving that the low gravity gave snow "fall" an entirely different meaning. But he didn't know that stillness would make the world seem frozen in time, as if they were all living in molasses.

Tonight, the stars decorated the sky behind Saturn's rings. The floating snow made it seem as if the stars were slowly drifting closer to them.

"Why did you bring me here again, dad?" you asked. Issac looked back into your eyes, thinking about how this was the only world you knew, where stray objects would stick in the air and snow took millions of years to fall.

"There's more..." Yusuf holds up his right hand. Grains of sand fall off and trail behind his fist, sticking in the air. He opens his fingers, and inside there's what looks like an old compass. "It came out of my dream. I saw my father. He gave this to me, and now... it's here."

"Do you think... they're real?" asks Yusuf. "Like, are these dreams really of our parents? Or are we making shit up because we've got nothing to remember?"

Soft crunches of wet sand under boots begins to fall in random patterns. "Where did you find that, Yusuf?" asks Sarah.

"Just a bit upshore, next to five other objects." He points to further up on the sandy bank. "I think there's something for each of us."

You walk over, and find the assortment of objects. The other's follow. Poking out from under the sand, you see a long, rusted gold rod. It's a telescope. There's freshly turned sand beside it, where Yusuf must have pulled out the compass. Joshua picks up a mahogany (?) guitar, stroking his hands along its wooden frame. A cannister with wiring and piping sticking out stuck out from the sand at an angle. Sarah brushes the sand away and yanks at it. Teeneese is brushing away the sand from something you can't make out. But you see how she falls to her knees, how her jaw is swinging. As if she was gagging on the words trying to leave her mouth at once.

"It's a black box. From when... My son died, in a plane crash. I listened to this for the first time, last night. In my dream. Not for the first time, but... the first time, again."

[[How did he die?]]
[[I'm sorry.]]
[[What does the recording say?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="290" name="Investigate the telescope." tags="" position="29060,160">You pulled at the telescope, nudging the rest of it closer to the surface. It feels... softer than you'd imagine it should, though perhaps that's just your gloves. The sand gets kicked up easily, but you can feel the base underneath is causing it to drag. (if good rel w/ Joana) Your brother comes over and helps you to pull it out. Together, both of you pull. Sand flies up and hits your helmets, more trailing up into the sky behind you. (if not) After a few more tugs, the telescope comes loose. Sand flies up and hits your helmet, more trailing up into the sky behind you.

"This was in your dream too?" asks Joana. (if not there, add: , who walks over after seeing what you pulled out.)

[[I don't think they were dreams. More like memories.]]
[[Yeah, I dreamed about... our parents.]]
[[Yeah, I dreamed about... a place called Earth.]]


"I don't think they were dreams," you say, placing the telescope softly onto the sand. "More like memories."

"At this point, there's no way to tell the difference." He turns the telescope on its stand, bringing the eyepiece closer. "What did you see?"

"I saw Earth." The name rolled off your tongue. "Through the telescope. Issac... or, Dad... he showed me Earth. We were... somewhere with snow. There was a planet in the sky, with rings."


"Yeah, I dreamed about... our parents," you say, placing the telescope softly onto the sand.

"So did I." He turns the telescope on its stand, bringing the eyepiece closer. "The telescope belonged to our grandmother, dad's mom. He kept it near our habitat's window."

"Issac... well, dad showed me a place called Earth, through the telescope." The planet's name rolled off your tongue. "We were... somewhere with snow. There was a planet in the sky, with rings."



"Yeah, I dreamed about... a place called Earth." The name rolled off your tongue. "I saw it through a telescope. Issac... or, Dad... he showed me Earth. We were... somewhere with snow. There was a planet in the sky, with rings."


"Must be Saturn," she says. "It's where you went, when you left."

[[What do you mean, when I left?]]
[[Left from where? Left Earth?]]
[[You didn't come with me?]]

"What do you mean, when I left?" you ask.

"My memory was on a place called Mars. Our home, I think. For me at least." It's hard to see through both of your helmets, but she looks as confused as you are. "Mom and dad decided to leave for a place called Saturn, but I chose to stay. I didn't want to leave."

"Left from where?" you ask. "Left Earth?"

"No, Mars. My memory was on a place called Mars. Our home, I think. For me at least." It's hard to see through both of your helmets, but he looks as confused as you are. "Mom and dad decided to leave for a place called Saturn, but I chose to stay. I didn't want to leave."

"No, I didn't. My memory was on a place called Mars. Our home, I think. For me at least." It's hard to see through both of your helmets, but she looks as confused as you are. "Mom and dad decided to leave for a place called Saturn, but I chose to stay. I didn't want to leave."


"And I went with them?" you ask.

"You were barely a kid, of course you did." She looks at you, as if your face had changed.

[[Then something brought us both here.]]
[[Who did you stay with on Mars, after we left?]]
[[If we lived on Mars, why did they show me Earth?]]

"Then something brought us both here," you say.

"Or different things sent us away." She leans down and tries to look through the telescope's eye piece. "Ah, can't see shit through the helmet. Plus, it's day, but it's not like the other laws of physics have made sense, right? Here, you try."

He steps back, and leaves the telescope for you.


"Who did you stay with on Mars, after we left?" you ask.

"Tio Amarizio. Mom's brother. He was too old to come with us, and it didn't seem like he wanted to. So, I stayed with him." She leans down and tries to look through the telescope's eye piece. "Ah, can't see shit through the helmet. Plus, it's day, but it's not like the other laws of physics have made sense, right? Here, you try."

He steps back, and leaves the telescope for you.


"If we lived on Mars, why did they show me Earth?" you ask.

"I think that was the home they left, like you left Mars." She leans down and tries to look through the telescope's eye piece. "Ah, can't see shit through the helmet. Plus, it's day, but it's not like the other laws of physics have made sense, right? Here, you try."

She steps back, and leaves the telescope for you.

[[Look through the telescope.]]
[[Don't look through the telescope.]]


You lean down and bring the eye piece as close to your helmet as you can. It's small, but you see some light coming through the other end as it's pointed into the sky. There's a black backdrop, and it looks like there's two blue spots, though it could be the helmet refracting the light coming from the lens.

"In... my dream, when I chose to stay behind, the telescope stayed with me. On Mars." He spoke slowly. "I'd say its weird you remember it going all the way to the moons of Saturn, but that's not even half as strange as it appearing here."

[[Then the dreams can't be our actual memories.]]
[[However our memory is coming back, there must be mistakes.]]
[[Maybe we... remembered things differently, or we're missing context.]]

"Then the dreams can't be our actual memories," you say as you pull back from the telescope.

"However our memory is coming back, there must be mistakes," you say as you pull back from the telescope.

"Maybe we... remembered things differently, or we're missing context," you say as you pull back from the telescope.

"Maybe... I just don't know what to think, about any of this." She turns back and looks around at everyone else, each looking at the objects strewn across the beach from their dreams. "We just need to find our way back home."

As if you're noticing strings connecting you to something that you're tugging closer. Each of the five faces coming towards you seems to be feeling that pull in their own way.

They reach you, each holding some piece of their past that somehow found them. Joana holds the telescope, and Sarah drags over the water purifier. Joshua's slung the guitar over his shoulder and Yusuf's still tinkering with his compass. (TEENEESE?)
 
"What's going on, $name/Captain?" asks Yusuf. "What is all this?"

Joshua scoffs. "It's obvious, isn't it? Whatever's here is trying to scare us."

"Scare us? For all we know, they don't even know what we're doing," says Sarah. "This could... still just be the natural processes of the planet."

"How does a planet read our dreams? Bring back our memories? Make a fucking guitar?" His hands gesticulate, stunted by the suit's limitations, but his panic is clear.

Yusuf has an array of electrical and mechanical parts, a portable power source, and a modular micro-drone, capable of deployment if needed. Joshua is equipped with an extensive inventory management system, that will track and organize these instruments as well as any samples collected. An essential task, to be sure.

The Captain/$name (FIND THINGS THAT WILL BE PLOT RELEVANT !!! Maybe direct drone control?)

You are all equipped with a pulse-beam emmiter (come up with something better/less cliche/more thematic), capable of emitting a pulse of energy in both lethal and non-lethal quantities, in addition to the communication devices you are already aware of. (Any questions? -&gt; write q&amp;a here if there's room for more exposition)"

Joshua reaches into a pouch and produces a small white oval, that can fit in the palm of his hand. "This is the gun?"

"That is a crude description of the device, but yes," says CINDI. "That is the gun."

You see a smile flash across Joshua's face from behind the suit, as he puts the device back into the pouch.

"What should we do with these objects?" asks Sarah. "Just... leave them here?"

"Unless you wish to carry a water purifier around with you," says Teeneese.

"I'm taking the compass with me, that's for sure," says Yusuf.

[[You can each make that choice for yourselves.]]
[[If you can, hold onto the objects.]]
[[I recommend leaving them behind.]]

"You can each make that choice for yourselves," you say.

"If you can, hold onto the objects," you say. "Who knows, they may come in handy."

"I recommend leaving them behind," you say. "They could be dangerous."

Yusuf puts his compass in his pocket, and Sarah leaves the water purifier near your telescope. Joshua slings his guitar awkwardly over his back, with the strap attached to it, (did you already say this?) while Teeneese (does something with her object that you need to decide!!!). The group is prepared.

[[Good luck, stay safe.]]
[[Check in every hour.]]
[[No one do anything stupid.]]

"Good luck, stay safe," you tell the group, as you and Teeneese/Joana walk off.

"I recommend every group checking in at least every hour for a status update," says CINDI. "And I reiterate the Captain's words: good luck."


"Check in every hour," you say. "Make sure to keep in contact."

"Good luck," says CINDI. "I will be with every team for support, as will the drones overhead."


"No one do anything stupid," you tell the group, as you and Teeneese/Joana walk off.

"I recommend every group checking in at least every hour for a status update," says CINDI. "And good luck."



Sand is difficult to traverse in low gravity, as you soon found out. Every step sends the shallow dune formations into disarray, floating up over your boots and slowly down, pooling about your heels, until you lift the foot, making it all tumble into the created crevice and so on. The first hour, noticing this pattern is the most noteworthy occurance. The sun has slowly grown higher in the sky. Teeneese/your sister takes some samples of the sand, but other than that, the landscape is no more alien than usual.

"This is Sarah, checking in after our first hour," she says over the suit intercom. "I've collected some wet soil samples from the shore, the (mini-lab) is processing now. I'll update with any noteworthy results, though they'll likely only come in by tomorrow."

Yusuf calls in next. "Not much to report here, either. We've been collecting soil samples as well, Joana is hoping to get a date on them soon. / When we regroup, hopefully Joana can get a date on them. Other than that, it's still a beautiful sunrise on the coast."

[[Sunrise? Seems at least like early morning to me.]]
[[Thanks for the report, everyone.]]
[[Same here, surprisingly nothing out of the ordinary.]]

"Sunrise? Seems at least like early morning to me," you reply, looking at the sun beating down at you from above. You're grateful for the suit's airflow.

"Well, I'm still not clear on where you grew up," quips Yusuf, "but I'm pretty sure what we're looking at is still a sunrise."

"That potential discrepancy is noted," says Teeneese. "We have nothing to report. I've taken samples for analysis as well."

"I look forward to dating those samples, too," says Joana.

OR: "That potential discrepancy is noted," says Teeneese over the comm.

"Well, we've got nothing else to report, being honest," says Joana. "I also took some soil samples I'm trying to date."


"Thanks for the report, everyone," you reply, looking at the sun beating down at you from above. You're grateful for the suit's airflow.

OR: "Well, we've got nothing else to report, being honest," says Joana. "I also took some soil samples I'm trying to date."


"Sounds like that'll be a pretty dry romance," says Joshua, sounding far too proud of himself.

[[Laugh.]]
[[Don't laugh.]]

You chuckle. "I'll let you all know how it goes in an hour."

You don't laugh. Teeneese holds back a small chuckle. It's still pretty awkward. "Well, yeah. Nothing else to report."


The comms go silent, and the walking begins once again. Another hour passes, all you're met with is more sand. The second check in goes like the first, and so does the third. You start to loose track of time. Some hours pass in an instant, others take an eternity. The sun continues to rise. Far in the distance, you start to see hints of a more complex geology. Large sand formations, potentially rock as well. No signs of anything green, anything alive.

[[Send drones to investigate formations.]]
[[Keep walking.]]

"CINDI, can the drone take a closer look at those formations?"

(stuff about the geologic formations)

There's a noticeable increase in heat, as the sun slowly continues to rise. Another hour passes, and Yusuf calls to check in.

"No one else finds it weird the Sun's still at the horizon?" asks Yusuf.

[[It's not at the horizon. It's clearly in the sky.]]
[[If it's still at the horizon for you, then yes.]]

"It's not at the horizon," you say. "It's clearly in the sky."

"If it's still at the horizon for you, then yes," you say. "That would be very weird."

CINDI interjects. "There is the capacity to send visual data across the network connecting the six of you, that may help with this disagreement."

"We've got cameras in these suits? Sweet," says Yusuf. "I think of everything."

A moment later, an image appears on your screen. It's (Teeneese, standing awkwardly besides a rising sun, identical to what you saw this morning.) (Sibling, hands stretched up besides a rising sun, identical to what you saw this morning).

[[We must be... experiencing time differently.]]
[[That's impossible.]]
[[Can anyone explain this?]]

"We must be... experiencing time differently," you say, sending a photo back to Yusuf. "Look, the sun's clearly risen. You must be stuck in some kind of... frozen space in time."

"Don't be ridiculous," says Teeneese. "This planet is tidally locked. It's the simplest explanation."


"That's impossible," you say, sending a photo back to Yusuf. "Look, the sun's positioned completely different here."

"It's clearly not impossible," says Teeneese. "This planet is tidally locked. It's the simplest explanation."


"Can anyone explain this?" you ask, sending a photo back to Yusuf. "Look, the sun's positioned completely different here." 

"This planet is tidally locked. It's the simplest explanation," says Teeneese.

[[That... makes sense.]]
[[What does that mean?]]
[[That can't be right.]]

"That... makes sense," you say.

"Tidally locked? What does that mean?" asks Yusuf. "Even if I did know, I sure as hell don't now."


"What does that mean?" you ask.


"That can't be right," you say.

"What does that even mean?" asks Yusuf. "Even if I used to know, I sure as hell don't now."


"It means this planet's rotation and orbit are locked in so that one side is always facing the sun. From a single spot, the sun will always look the same, like by the shore. But, for anyone moving inland, they're moving further onto the side always facing the sun, so it'll look higher in the sky. We must have landed on the night side of the planet."

"So... there's no day and night?" asks Joshua. "Just, always day and always night?"

"That is correct. It also means this desert will grow extremely hot the further we go, as we move more into the endless sun. And, the further into the dark side of the planet, the colder it will be."

[[Does that sound accurate, CINDI?]]
[[It's a good working hypothesis.]]

"Does that sound accurate, CINDI?"

"Based on current observable data, yes," she replies. "It also makes the shoreline an ideal base of operations, where the temperature should be stable, neither too cold nor warm."

"We should head back soon, the further we go the hotter it'll get," says Joana

(or:) "I recommend returning to the shore, if we go much further we risk overheating," says (Teeneese).

[[You're right, let's head back.]]
[[We should go a bit further.]]

"You're right," you say. "Let's head back."

The two of you turn back, and follow your own footprints in the sand back towards the shore, barely visible on the horizon.


"We should go a bit further," you say.

You push forward, with (Sibling/Teeneese) following behind, towards the rock formations coming out of the sand.


After some time, you notice something before you. As you squint in the distance, you see a dark patch near the base of a steep sand dune, a silhouette of what could be a person. It's sizzling, vibrating so quickly it's difficult to notice. 

"Do you see that?" you ask.

"I see nothing," says Teeneese. / "See what?" asks Joana. "There's nothing there."

[[There's some humanoid figure.]]
[[It must be... nothing.]]

"There's some humanoid figure," you say. "By that sand dune."

Even as the words leave your mouth, you blink and its gone.

"There is nothing there, $name/Captain." / "Are you feeling okay?"

[[I know what I saw.]]
[[It must be... nothing.]]

"I know what I saw."

"It must be... nothing.

The both of you continue in the heat. You know an hour passes, but only because the others call to check in. You think you see the figure again, on some occasions. But then it materializes clearly before you, a dozen feet from where you stand. Its form doesn't move, but the material making it up flows and shifts. You can't get a good look before it sprints off to your right.

[[Go back to the shore.]]
[[Run after it.]]

(WRITE ANOTHER PATH THAT DOESNT INVOLVE RUNNING TOWARDS IT)

Shore:

(if already going there:) You don't follow it, and continue walking to shore more quickly than you were.

"What's the hurry?"



Again. It appears in front of you.




Run:

You move as fast as you can in the sand, in the suit, in the air like molasses, running running lunging to approach the figure. It appears further off each time you blink. The sun is higher in the sky, its warmth and radiation raining down on you, the cooling systems of the suit can only do so much. The figure simmers in the distance. The thought comes across your mind it could be a mirage, but you dispel that. It's real. Too much has happened for this to be imagination.

You blink, and it's gone. Reappeared closer, to your right. You turn, making gains on the figure. Your breathing grows heavier, your heart rate faster. Several menacing beeps emit from your suit.

"I recommend slowing down your pace, especially in this heat," says CINDI. "These suits were not designed for this kind of exertion in this environment."

You continue, your steps turning into small jumps, heightened from the low gravity. After one of these, your foot catches the sand as you fall back, pushing your body softly into the sand. You see the bottom half of the figure steps in front of you.

"$name/Captain, you are suffering from extreme rates of heat exhaustion," her voice is more urgent than its ever been. "Please return to the shore. You must move to the shore. Please return to the shore."

Each blink seems to last longer than the last as you drag and float yourself forward towards the figure's feet.

[[Touch it.]]
[[Don't touch it.]]

You reach out, and touch the figure's foot. Even through the shielding of the suit, it's freezing. Slowly, you look up, as the shadowy figure begins to materialize. Legs, torso transforming into a jumpsuit much like the one you wore beneath the (exo?)suit. When you see the figure's face, instantly you know who it is. The mirage is of your mother.

Your hand is stretched out, but ultimately sits down onto the sandy surface. The figure's foot moves, toes up, heel moving towards your hand. Ink blotting the air as it streaks toward you, heel on the ground, foot falling over your fingers. Even through the shielding of the suit, it's freezing. But there was little force, it doesn't hurt. Slowly, you look up, as the shadowy figure begins to materialize. Legs, torso transforming into a jumpsuit much like the one you wore beneath the (exo?)suit. When you see the figure's face, instantly you know who it is. The mirage is of your mother.

Everything goes black. As unconsciousness grips you, CINDI's echos trickle into silence. "You must move to the shore. Please return to shore. You must move to the shore..."</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="357" name="Ch 3 Teeneese" tags="" position="35860,160">"I'll go with Teeneese," you say.

"Excellent," CINDI continues. "I suggest one group goes north along the coast, the other pair south, and the third inland towards the desert. As of yet, I am unsure of how the day-night cycle on this planet operates, but I will keep track of both hours elapsed and the sun's movement."

"We should be sure to meet back here before dark," says Yusuf. "I don't think we should spend the night separated."

"I'd like to stay along the coast," says Sarah. "If there's biosignatures too small for us to see, that's where they'll be germinating."

"I'll... go to the south," says Yusuf, looking down at his compass. "I know it doesn't mean anything, but... this is pointing in that direction."

[[That's a silly way to make a decision.]]

"I know it's silly, you're right," he says. "But fuck it, good as any direction, right? Teeneese/Joana and I will go that way."

"That leaves you and Teeneese/Joana to go into the desert," says CINDI. "In each of your packs, I want to highlight a few items that should prove useful for your task ahead. For scientific tools, Sarah is equipped with sample collection materials, including a portable drill, storage for soil samples, and a mobile lab equipped with acidics to distill organic material. Teeneese has a portable telescope, with an optional solar filter, and a miniaturized supercomputer capable of conducting simulations or processing data on the go. Joana has sample collection materials designed for geologic materials, including rock and ice samples, and an analysis instrument capable of dating the age of said samples.

You start to loose track of time. Some hours pass in an instant, others take an eternity. The sun continues to rise. Far in the distance, you start to see hints of a more complex geology.

"Based on current observable data, yes," she replies. "It also makes the shoreline an ideal base of operations, where the temperature should be stable, neither too cold nor warm."

The two of you turn back, and follow your own footprints in the sand back towards the shore, barely visible on the horizon.

After some time, you notice something before you. As you squint in the distance, you see a dark patch near the base of a steep sand dune, a silhouette of what could be a person. It's sizzling, vibrating so quickly it's difficult to notice. 

"Do you see that?" you ask.

"I see nothing," says Teeneese. / "See what?" asks Joana. "There's nothing there."

The both of you continue in the heat. You know an hour passes, but only because the others call to check in. You think you see the figure again, on some occasions. But then it materializes clearly before you, a dozen feet from where you stand. Its form doesn't move, but the material making it up flows and shifts. You can't get a good look before it sprints off to your right.

Again. It appears in front of you.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="388" name="Run after it." tags="" position="39060,160">You move as fast as you can in the sand, in the suit, in the air like molasses, running running lunging to approach the figure. It appears further off each time you blink. The sun is higher in the sky, its warmth and radiation raining down on you, the cooling systems of the suit can only do so much. The figure simmers in the distance. The thought comes across your mind it could be a mirage, but you dispel that. It's real. Too much has happened for this to be imagination.

You blink, and it's gone. Reappeared closer, to your right. You turn, making gains on the figure. Your breathing grows heavier, your heart rate faster. Several menacing beeps emit from your suit.

"I recommend slowing down your pace, especially in this heat," says CINDI. "These suits were not designed for this kind of exertion in this environment."

You continue, your steps turning into small jumps, heightened from the low gravity. After one of these, your foot catches the sand as you fall back, pushing your body softly into the sand. You see the bottom half of the figure steps in front of you.

"$name/Captain, you are suffering from extreme rates of heat exhaustion," her voice is more urgent than its ever been. "Please return to the shore. You must move to the shore. Please return to the shore."

Each blink seems to last longer than the last as you drag and float yourself forward towards the figure's feet.

[[Touch it.]]

Legs, torso transforming into a jumpsuit much like the one you wore beneath the (exo?)suit. When you see the figure's face, instantly you know who it is. The mirage is of your mother.

Sarah's is the microbial water purifier she made

Teeneese likely hides what she has, but if she does show it it's v revealing of a backstory you need to figure out!!

Whatever joshua gets makes him start crying. It's the guitar. Father broke it.


Chance to talk / try and talk to people about their memories

THEN, try and do mission:

1) get resources to go back



"There's nothing visible from here that looks valuable, or some kind of FTL fuel. But 



2) establish some kind of home

3) learn / explore

4) shift: to looking for what's fucking with them


Tools at hand:
- drones
- science 
- cindi

Potential solutions:
- sand could be melted into glass or something to be used to create shelter?
- seed samples on board that could be integrated into soil
- find "only life" in dirt are microbes / dead microbes? Relatively dismissive. Not intended to explain everything.

"Level 7, Docking." There's a jolt as the small compartment the both of you are inside of begins to move up. Your mother stares straight ahead. There's a silence that seems to swallow the space.

A soft fog is blown into the airlock. You shiver as it touches you, blanketing you in a numbness that you know will take over your entire body shortly. The gas prepared your body for the freezing liquid that would flood your sleeper, coaxing your body into a preserved sleep.

"What do you think we'll find?" she asks, waiting for the gas to do its work. "When we arrive?"

The electromagnetism running through the floor of the airlock releases. Your magnetic socks that kept you and your mother rooted to the ground on the station no longer work, leaving you to drift up. You grab the handles on the side of the room, and pull your way through the opening, into the spacecraft. You're in the inside of a sphere. Walls all white.

Ana Dandara cradled you, standing by a large window pane aboard the Cronus. All the travelers had boarded the ship, each saying their goodbyes before two years of sleep. Mars sat what looked like above them, the red rock that had been their home. Ana couldn't even see the colony from here. The planet looked the same as it had in those first images taken from flyby probes a century ago: naked and new, dead and timeless. Sitting amongst a profound silence. Ana Dandara thought of the miracle of your birth, how this place would hold the markers of that profound joy. Thought of how once the doctors were done with you, she cradled you not to differently to how she did now, but for the first time, thought of how she was one of the first mothers to hold a Martian in her arms.

Issac stood behind, preparing their sleepers for their trip. Ana asked him, without turning, "Do you think he'll/she'll/they'll remember?"

"Remember what?" asked Issac, not turning his head.

"Anything of this place," she replied. "Those barren rocks contain so much of me."

"We can hope," Issac turned. "Sometimes, I try to reach back and gather images from Earth. Not the ones from films or images, but my own. But I only come up with... snippets, single frames of memory. I'm not even sure they're real." Issac walked to join you at the window. "What do you remember?"

Ana looked down into your eyes as they shifted from her face to the window to the corners of the room. This was the first time you experienced weightlessness. Your parents had prepared a sedative for what they thought would be inevitable tears. But, they never came.

[[I can't remember anything.]]

[[Snow.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="422" name="I can't remember anything." tags="" position="42460,160">"I can't remember... anything." She spoke with a softness. You squirmed in her arms, confused. She never could imagine the stories her mother used to tell about Earth. She would always tell Ana about the inn she ran by a beach on the coast of Brazil. Ana thought about the stories her mother didn't tell, about what happened when the seas began to rise. About what they had to do to get on the ship to Mars. The stories she never had to tell, that Ana found as shards in offhand phrases and empty stares.

Issac turned back from the sleepers, looking past Ana and to the window. "That's Earth, isn't it?"

"Where?" Ana looked out, for a dot a bit more blue than the rest, but found nothing. But Issac was the stargazer, not her.

He came to the window, putting his arm around Ana and pointed. "There, I think. We should make sure the little one gets a good look."

Ana lifted you up a bit higher, bringing you to the window. Your eyes were wide.

"That ocean's out there, somewhere." Issac turned back from the sleepers, looking past Ana and to the window. "That's Earth, isn't it?"

Instead, she'd tell Ana about the inn she ran by a beach on the coast of Brazil, admist those same trees. Ana thought about the stories her mother didn't tell, about what happened when the seas began to rise. About what they had to do to get on the ship to Mars. The stories she never had to tell, that Ana found as shards in offhand phrases and empty stares. But the only memory she had was that afternoon, lost amongst the trees and brush.

"Those trees are still there, somewhere." Issac turned back from the sleepers, looking past Ana and to the window. "That's Earth, isn't it?"

"Where?" Ana looked out, for a dot a bit more blue than the rest, but found nothing. But Issac was the stargazer, not her.

She never asked her mother about that moment, the beginning of the end. Instead, Ana just listened as she'd tell her about the inn she ran by a beach on the coast of Brazil, admist those same trees. Ana thought about the stories her mother didn't tell, about what happened when the seas began to rise. About what they had to do to get on the ship to Mars.

Your helmet, half buried in sand blowing over the glass of your helmet. Clouds in the sky, between the grains of sand being thrown at the canvas of the world by wind. And the red. The trees. Great leaves, riddled with webbed patterns. Light sprinkling down on you, lighting up the sand covering your sight, turning it into gold.

The sand shifts, rolling to one side. There's the sound of wind. You can feel it, in the tips of your fingers poking out from underneath the blanket of the sand. Even through the gloves. Somehow, this all feels familiar.

From the ground, the wooden branches spiral. Their knotted together, it's impossible to tell where they begin and end. The wood is a light pink, the leaves a deep red. Your eyes sink into what almost looks like velvet growing off of the branches. Soft. Fluid. Your eyes are captivated upwards as you sit up, sand falling from your body.

There's stringy roots mixed together with the branches, rising up from the ground, connecting all the trunks among themselves, like webbing. This continues all the way up into what looks like a canopy, where the velvet leaves overtake the branches and roots.

More of these fossilized remains appear the further you go into the forest. They're not all branches, some are the imprints of leaves. You and Sarah spread out, walking among the mummified corpses of the trees.

The world starts to move as the tangled branches grow closer and closer, the floor and wispy roots sinking away.

[[Grab hold of the root.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="462" name="Grab hold of the branch." tags="" position="46460,160">As a branch approaches, you stretch out your hand, and grab hold of it.

A leaf floats towards you. Not down, just past. The wind makes it dance, the deep red reflecting the rays of light breaking through the canopy. It looks like it's swimming. Everything does. The roots dance and tease the branches, the branches sway the leaves and the leaves ruffle with the gusts of wind and spill their color out. Looking back to the desert, you see the leaves trail off into the distance.

You grab for a branch to hold you still, but it slips from your fingers. You continue to spin, and your legs hit a nearby trunk. The edge of your boot easily slices through the wood. A white puss bubbles out from the gash, sticking to your boot.

The drone maneuvers to look at the structure from above, revealing a pile of leaves in a central corridor created by the branches near the center of the structure.

"I'm stuck to this root. There's got to be a way out." She tries to lean forward to look at her leg, but the suit makes it difficult. "Can you take a closer look?"

You move closer to the root connected to Joana's suit. It's sliced off cleanly, and pressed tightly against the suit where you assume the tear is. The white philament(?) seems to work as a glue, pressing the root up against the suit. You notice hints of red mixed in with the puss. It must be blood, from a cut underneath.

"I see multiple options. It appears the material produced by the root is acting as an adhesive, but the root is providing the solidity to keep the tear closed.

You take the other end of the root, and swing it around Joana, bringing the cut off end back to her thigh. You push the open end to the glob of material plugging up the cut in her suit, waiting to see if the loop will seal itself.

"Is... is it working?" Joana asks. "How long is this supposed to take?"

Soon, you see the root begin to excrete small amounts of the white puss, connecting with the pool already on Joana's thigh. The root begins to take hold, connecting with its other end, completing the circuit.

"It's done."

"Good." Joana pushes herself up and away from the trunk, moving freely. The root floats above her head for a moment, before coming to rest on her right shoulder. One end loops around the back, the other from the front. "Let's get the fuck out of this forest."

You soon reach the forest's exit, guided by the drone you sent out earlier. Your first sign is the sound of waves, slow and heavy. Then, blue and white peak through the fauna you've been surrounded by. Pushing through the last roots and branches, you find yourself again on the sand, the shoreline before you. In the distance, you see the water turn to ice, rising up into glaciers in the distance.

"$name, is that you?" It's Sarah's voice. Down to your right, you see a huddle of figures, one waving at you. "And Joana?"

"Yes, we both made it." You look at Joana, her hand holding the root running through her suit's leg. Outside the dappled light of the forest, you notice a slight glow to its rubbery surface.

"Thank god. Come back to camp, tell us everything."

The walk back is slow through the sand. It's darker, now that the sunlight is filtered through the trees. The winds are more violent, here. Sand kicks itself up to your helmet. But you arrive, after some time. As you approach, everyone gathers to greet you. But they each pause upon seeing the appendage on Joana's leg. Everyone grows quiet. You try and explain, how the roots loop. How you thought this might keep the seal intact. Sarah nods, the others ask questions. Joana assures them it's just connected to the suit, she can take it off in the safety of the pod. It's just temporary, until repairs. You think of the cut you know lies underneath the tear, but say nothing. You start to feel something underneath shifting. Whispers that aren't words. And feel yourself floating more than standing, a canoe on the water. One more gust until it tips.

"I love you both," says CINDI, in the dark just before sleep. "Like family. I know that isn't appropriate to say, especially since you've forgotten so much. But both of you, your parents, mean the world to me."

You soon reach the forest's exit, guided by the drone you sent out earlier. Your first sign is the sound of waves, slow and heavy. Then, blue and white peak through the fauna you've been surrounded by. Pushing through the last roots and branches, you find yourself again on the sand, the shoreline before you. In the distance, you see the water turn to ice, rising up into glaciers in the distance.

"$name, is that you?" It's Sarah's voice. Down to your right, you see a huddle of figures, one waving at you.

"Yeah, it's me." You hear a sigh of relief. Her hands go down.

The walk back is slow through the sand. It's darker, now that the sunlight is filtered through the trees. The winds are more violent, here. Sand kicks itself up to your helmet. But you arrive, after some time. Everyone is quiet. You try and explain, try to be kind to yourself but fail. They, in turn, try to be kind. But you know you had a choice, and you made the wrong one. You start to feel something underneath shifting. Whispers that aren't words. And feel yourself floating more than standing, a canoe on the water. One more gust until it tips.

"I loved her, as if she were a daughter. Just as I love you," said CINDI, in the dark just before sleep. "I know that isn't appropriate to say, especially since you've forgotten so much. But both of you, your parents, mean the world to me."

The walk back is slow through the sand. It's darker, now that the sunlight is filtered through the trees. The winds are more violent, here. Sand kicks itself up to your helmet. But you arrive, after some time. Explain what you want to explain. Don't what you don't. While you're reciting half-truths, you start to feel something underneath shifting. Whispers that aren't words. And feel yourself floating more than standing, a canoe on the water. One more gust until it tips.

"Are you ready for this?" Sarah Noodin Day asks you, and you can tell from how wide her eyes are, she's really asking if she is.

[[We both are.]]
[[I am.]]
[[Doesn't matter, we're doing it.]]

"We both are," you reply. Sarah gives a brief smile, easing your nerves as you see her relax. She breathes in deeply, her lungs causing her body to rise, and then out. Her earrings float up for a moment, staying afloat in the weak gravity. They were a pair of wood-carved turtles, and seemed be swimming as they drifted down to rest. "That's right. We both are."

(EDIT: Add more on Elliot, and his proposal being on quantum-entanglement communications)


You were both in a sterile waiting room, chairs lining the walls. You sat in one as Sarah stood, looking towards the closed door at one end. A middle aged man in a plain gray suit sat a few chairs down from you, reviewing notes on a data pad. He hadn't said a word to either of you. The man in the gray suit stood, suddenly, and walked towards the doors at the far end of the room. (find a way to make this / change it to be significant)

"Good luck!" Sarah called after him. He turned and mumbled something resembling a thank you in reply, before continuing through the doors and down the hallway beyond. "Someone woke up on the wrong side of the sleeping pod."

[[He could have been nicer.]]
[[We're not here to make friends.]]
[[He's just nervous.]]

"He could have been nicer," you replied. "We're all here for the same thing, after all."

"I'm sure that's the problem," said Sarah. "Everyone sees these funding pitches as a zero-sum game."


"We're not here to make friends," you replied. "We're all here for the same thing, after all."

"That's the problem," said Sarah. "Everyone sees these funding pitches as a zero-sum game."


"He's just nervous," you replied. "We shouldn't take it personally."

"You're right," said Sarah. "These funding pitches just throw everyone off."


The heavy doors magnetically snapped back to their closed position. Nothing was left to swing closed naturally on the station, since the low gravity meant it would take a couple months for a door to swing closed on its own. Plastered on the doors was a large X with three dots, one on the lower right of the X, the other on the upper left, with a small dot underneath: the symbol of the Proxima Corporation.

(Proxima symbol here)

It was the symbol on every labcoat, jumpsuit, shuttle, every piece of official tech and hardware. There were variations, of course. Some spelled out the whole name, "proXima." But they all had that oversized "X," like the treasure on a kid's pirate map, and they all had the dots, like three eyes watching you. Really, they were supposed to be stars, the three stars of the Proxima Centauri System, the closest solar system to our own, a mere four light years away. The whole point of all of this was to get there, to find humanity's next home. And that symbol was plastered everywhere, lest anyone forget.

[[I hate that X.]]
[[It's a nice X, isn't it?]]


"I hate that X," you say softly.

"Oh, it's not that bad," Sarah replies without moving her head. "They could leave it off the underwear, though."

You laughed at that, somehow it made the symbol less intimidating.


"It's a nice X, isn't it?" you say softly.

"It is nice," Sarah replies without moving her head. "They could leave it off the underwear, though."

You laughed at that, somehow it made the symbol less pristine.






"I think they're going to call us in soon," Sarah tells you, already standing by the doors. You stand to join her.

(If doesn't hate X, wears a proxima tie)

You look at your reflection in the gloss of the doors, a white dress shirt with silver pants and jacket, the pant legs open towards the bottom and jacket open at the middle, leaving your father's tie clearly visible. It was kept flat with pins attaching it to your shirt. You wanted to make sure your mother would see it. Sarah wore a similar outfit, without a tie. On each of your feet, Proxima's anti-grav socks that kept you comfortably on the station's floor. Both of you coordinated for subdued decadence. It was important to impress, but not overwhelm.

Sarah is tapping her left foot. "Still feel weird, giving presentations like these to your mom?"

[[I've gotten used to it.]]
[[Still pretty weird.]]
[[Not usually, but this is different.]]

"I've gotten used to it," you reply. Sarah gives you a look in the reflection that makes it clear she's not convinced. Her foot stops.

"She'll be thinking about him, too, you know." Sarah turned to look at you, turtles swimming as her head shifts. "Even if she pretends not to."


"Still pretty weird," you reply. Sarah gives you a look of care in the reflection. Her foot stops.

[[I'm not thinking about him.]]
[[I wish I'd known him.]]
[[I wish she wouldn't pretend.]]

"I'm not thinking about him," you lie. "I didn't even know him." Sarah sighs and turns back, but your mind lingers on your uncle.

You've been searching for a real memory of him, trying to picture anything that wasn't a face on a screen. There's something you've almost managed to grasp... Not quite a memory. Just a feeling.



"I wish I'd known him," you share. Sarah nods. Her hand reaches out and gives yours a small squeeze.

"I have a sister, back home. Born less than a year after I left." Sarah turns back, but your mind lingers on 

You've been searching for your first memory of him, trying to piece together as much of him as you can. There's something you've almost managed to grasp... Not quite a memory. Just a feeling.




"I wish she wouldn't pretend," you confess. Sarah nods and laughs.

"I do too. If she would at least admit why she's against our research to herself, it might make our job of convincing her easier." Sarah turns back, but your mind lingers on your father.

You've been searching for your first memory of him, trying to piece together as much of him as you can. There's something you've almost managed to grasp... Not quite a memory. Just a feeling.



A soft and familiar voice tells you, "The Board is ready. You may enter." Glancing to Sarah, you see she's heard the same, though the voice was only a whisper sent directly as a neural spark within your brain.

"Thank you, CINDI. We'll enter now," Sarah says aloud. The doors swing open slowly, revealing a short corridor before it opens up into the larger atrium.

"Good luck," the artificial intelligence whispers one again. You wonder if she said the same to Sarah. Her strut of forced confidence tells nothing. You walk through the doors. The corridor was narrow, the walls lined with design sketches from the various inventions ProXima had created to bring them to the sprawling network of colonies they were today.

[[Glance at the walls.]]
[[Keep walking.]]

You saw a sketch of the Cronos, the ship that took the first batch of colonists to Saturn, the ship you and your parents slept in for two years before your arrival. Then there was the NAME, a much larger vessel, carrying colonists to Titan and more to the station. That's when Sarah came, and when the Huygen Station on Titan began. Designs for the Venus colonies were there as well, disk-shaped metallic monstrosities that floated in the planet's upper atmosphere. It really was incredible, looking at all these machines lined up next to each other. The last design was of one of the ProXima Arks: a ship larger and more complex than anything a human had created. The design was to transport humans to another solar system. The designs were always in flux, the main problem being an energy source. To keep cryogenic sleepers running long enough for such a long trip was a near impossible task.

Just as you reached the end of the corridor, CINDI's voice echoed out on the atrium's speakers. "Our last proposal comes from Astrobiologist Sarah Noodin Day and Drone Operator $name de Silva." There is a mix of vigorous and halfhearted applauses as both of you enter the atrium. Your muscles tense up as you feel almost two dozen eyes focusing in on the two of you.

You kept walking towards the atrium, face forward. CINDI's voice echoed out on the atrium's speakers. "Our last proposal comes from Astrobiologist Sarah Noodin Day and Drone Operator $name Alexander de Silva." There is a mix of vigorous and halfhearted applauses as both of you enter the atrium. Your muscles tense up as you feel almost two dozen eyes focusing in on the two of you.


Many of the faces were recognizable. Yusuf Basara was there, of course, as the Head of Engineering. He was the one who recommended you come on as a drone specialist, after taking note of your aptitude for spacial reasoning. 


The lead Astrobiologist on the station, Josiah Holtz, was present as well. Apparently, he had been a friend of your fathers, though the two of you rarely spoke. Sarah would often complain about his bad breath, which was impressive considering most of the food everyone ate was synthesized paste.

The board members on station were present as well. There was Aleski Dolohov, one of the first Martian colonists and a decent engineer. He created a propulsion company that was absorbed by ProXima, bringing travel times throughout the solar system down to the scale of months and years instead of decades. Then there was Chiko Yamamoto, an assistant administrator on Cassini Station. Born on Earth, she had worked her way up the corporate ladder to become the head of ProXima's operations there. When the second batch of colonists came to Saturn, she took the chance to get off Earth. Sukhveer Singh was the last board member present. Originally born on one of the Venus Orbital Colonies, he was transferred to Enceladus to lend his expertize as one of the most renowned microbiologists working for ProXima. Though Holtz was the head of the science team on the station, Sukhveer was responsible for the majority of breakthroughs.

Then, there was the head of the board: . 


All these eyes, human and android alike, were upon you, but there was one set that wasn't. Ana Dandara de Silva, President of Proxima, had her eyes down at her digital notepad. You noticed her foot tapping, and wished your mother would stop and just look at you like everyone else.

Sarah stepped out onto the main floor of the atrium, where lights highlighted the presenters and left the audience in the dimmer blue light that lit the station in the evenings. The seats rose in a semi-circle around the stage, rising with each level. Sarah turned and nodded for you to join her, and so you did.

"Members of the Board and Leadership of ProXima, thank you for your time," began Sarah. "We are here to propose a scientific expedition that we think will be essential to the survival of this station, of ProXima, indeed, even the survival of the human race." 



They had practiced this opening line together. Sarah insisted on the dramatic flair, despite your hesitation. You couldn't argue that she was wrong, though.

[[Hopefully, that got your attention.]]
[[It's really not that dramatic.]]
[[neutral response]]

"Hopefully, that got your attention." You gave the audience a small smile. "We are proposing an expedition to retrieve samples of Enceladus' local microbial life form from their natural habitat, in the ocean underneath the icy surface of this moon." There were some murmurs, you saw Sarah's shoulders tense up.

"We both know the elephant in the room," said Sarah. They hadn't planned this. "That the last time we sent anything under the ice, that, well --"

Sarah looked to you, asking for you to help give her the words. You knew what she meant, what was a lump in her throat. You remember the same lump, years ago, in your mother's throat.

[[Remember.]]


FLASHBACK


You took a glance to your mother. Her foot had stopped tapping and she was now attentive. But no tension had left her body. "The first part of our proposal will be with Sarah, explaining how she believes these samples could be the key to solving our impending energy crisis. Then, I will present on modifications to our fleet of drones that will allow this retrieval to be possible. And finally, we'll have some time for a Q&amp;A." You step back, and Sarah steps forward.

"We all know the desperate state of Earth. We know the climate control systems aren't powerful enough to keep the planet livable. We know the colonies on Mars and Venus are overflowing with refugees, and that the new colonies on Titan and Europa won't be enough. The fact we've even lasted this long is only due to the energy harvested from the microbial life discovered here, and the genius of the Microbial Fuel Cells developed by the scientists and engineers that have made Cassini Station an irreplaceable part of ProXima. 

"But the samples we collect from the geysers aren't enough to power the whole network of colonies. Our supply cannot maintain the increasing demand. I've been at this station for five years, now. In that time, our understanding of the imperius xenentia microbe has excelled. We've learned to harness their energy-generating properties, understand their longevity of life, and more. But we still have no way to cultivate more on our own.

"If we can find a way to produce these microbes artificially, our energy problem could essentially be solved. More complex propulsion would make the ProXima Ark project a reality within our lifetimes, climate control could bring Earth to a stable level of habitability. Transportation throughout the solar system could be exponentially easier. We've been trying to find a way to do this for nearly a decade, but we can't learn enough from the samples we have.

"The little data we retrieved from Issac's mission almost a decade ago indicate there's something different about the microbes in their natural habitat in the ocean of Enceladus. We aren't sure if that's because of some unknown quality of the ocean, or perhaps being in closer proximity with other microbes, but we have theorized it's in that environment they reproduce. We've tried to replicate those conditions in our labs, but to no luck. We're unsure of what we're even trying to replicate. That's why it's so important we return to observe and collect."

Sarah had made these arguments many times before, almost always to be shut down. No one wanted to go back under the ocean when there was a steady supply of microbes sent up through the geysers. But she was right, they wouldn't be enough. Neither of you understood why there was so much resistance for a project that just made sense.

"Now, $name will discuss our proposal for how to make that happen." Sarah stepped back and you stepped forward. Looking out again, you saw your mother divert her gaze. Yusuf gave you a comforting nod.

"ProXima's fleet of drones is the best in the business. We've perfected their use for sample collection from the geysers, as well as exterior repairs to the station, and a host of other menial tasks. But they've never been used for exploration in extreme environments, at least here on Enceladus. Working closely with our engineers, we've developed a drone that would be able to adeptly survive the extreme cold of Enceladus' ocean, collect liquid and organic samples, and record visual and spectral data."

As you speak, the holographic projection presents the drone design, highlighting the various components and modifications.

"The drone will travel through an active geyser through Enceladus' ice shell to gain access to the ocean beneath. Once there, the drone will collect samples at various depths, and return up through a geyser for further analysis. This will teach us more about the moon we're living on, about the microbes that power this station, and hopefully reveal how we can cultivate more of these beings on our own." Sarah came back to join you at the stage's center. "We can do all of this with technology we currently have, and if we're right, it could... fix everything."











"All we need is your approval and support," concluded Sarah. "Thank you."

There was haphazard applause. You knew this would be the difficult part. "Now, let's hear your questions!" you say, hoping your positive attitude will encourage the board to go easy on both of you./

Aleski Dolohov was the first to speak. "Why have the drone travel through an active geyser? Why not an inactive one?"

[[We know it connects to the ocean.]]
[[Inactive canals could have frozen.]]

"We know it connects all the way to the ocean, otherwise we wouldn't see liquid come up through the visor. Others were a bit harder to please. 

Sukhveer asks "What if your hypothesis about reproducibility is wrong? And studying the microbes in their natural habitat won't actually make artificially producing them any easier?"

Sarah replied, "



Singh seemed to be satisfied with this answer. Holtz took up the questioning from there. "We've rejected countless similar proposals because they were never worth the cost. We have a steady, if not exhuberant, supply of microorganisms streaming up through the geysers. Why risk this investment, even if it's just financial this time, when there's no need?"

[[There is a very clear need.]]
[[For the sake of exploration.]]
[[Let Sarah answer.]]

RESPNSES






RESPONSES

The exchange lingered through the atrium. CINDI's voice returned. "If there are no more questions, we will conduct a vote." 

One by one, the various board and scientific committee members voted on whether to fund the project or not. The vote stood at three in favor, two against. But both ???  as the head of the board and Ana as the station Administrator had veto power. Their votes were really the only thing that mattered.

The android representing Song stuttered forward to vote. It's voice became jarbled and low for a moment before snapping back into regularity, a small detail not meant to distract from the task at hand. Then, with perfect politeness, voted in favor of the proposal. Holts gave an audible gasp, Ana looked confused. Yusuf, a few rows away, looked quietly content.

All eyes now turned to Ana Dandara. Taking a moment to herself, she collects her thoughts. As long as she doesn't veto, the proposal will certainly last and be put in motion. Not looking at anyone in particular, Ana casts her vote. "Abstain."

There's audible confusion, that begins as a trickle and then explodes into a roar of gossip. You and Sarah were hysteric with joy for having passed the proposal.

You were both in a comfortable waiting room, a hallway really, with chairs lining the walls. You sat in one as Sarah stood, looking towards the closed door on one side. After a moment, a young man not much older than yourself walks out, wearing a thick woolen sweater. A datapad held under his arm. He doesn't say a word to either of you.

"How'd it go?" asks Sarah, calling after him. He doesn't even turn to acknowledge the question, much less reply, and continues down the hallway until he's out of sight. "I guess Elliot woke up on the wrong side of the sleeping pod."

[[He could have been nicer.]]
[[We're not here to make friends.]]
[[He's just nervous.]]

"He could have been nicer," you replied. "We're all here for the same thing, after all."

"I'm sure that's the problem," said Sarah. "Everyone sees these funding pitches as a zero-sum game."


"We're not here to make friends," you replied. "We're all here for the same thing, after all."

"That's the problem," said Sarah. "Everyone sees these funding pitches as a zero-sum game."


"He's just nervous," you replied. "We shouldn't take it personally."

"You're right," said Sarah. "These funding pitches just throw everyone off."


The heavy doors magnetically snapped back to their closed position. Nothing was left to swing closed naturally on the station, since the low gravity meant it would take a couple months for a door to swing closed on its own. Above the door was large lettering, "Office of Ezra Martel."

Plastered on the doors themselves was a large X with three dots, one on the lower right of the X, the other on the upper left, with a small dot underneath: the symbol of the Proxima Corporation.

(Proxima symbol here)

It was the symbol on every labcoat, jumpsuit, shuttle, every piece of official tech and hardware. There were variations, of course. Some spelled out the whole name, "proXima." But they all had that oversized "X," and they all had the dots, like three eyes watching you. They were supposed to be stars, the three stars of the Proxima Centauri System, the closest solar system to Sol, a mere four light years away. The whole point of all of this was to get there, to find humanity's next home. And that symbol was plastered everywhere, lest anyone forget.

[[I hate that X.]]
[[It's a nice X, isn't it?]]


"I hate that X," you say softly.

"Oh, it's not that bad," Sarah replies without moving her head. "They could leave it off the underwear, though."

You laughed at that, somehow it made the symbol less intimidating.


"It's a nice X, isn't it?" you say softly.

"It is nice," Sarah replies without moving her head. "They could leave it off the underwear, though."

You laughed at that, somehow it made the symbol less pristine.


A soft and familiar voice tells you, "He is ready. You may enter." Glancing to Sarah, you see she's heard the same, though the voice was only a whisper sent directly as a neural spark within your brain.

"Thank you, CINDI. We'll enter now," Sarah says aloud. The doors swing open slowly, revealing a short corridor before it opens up into the larger atrium.

"Good luck," the artificial intelligence whispers one again. You wonder if she said the same to Sarah. Her strut of forced confidence tells nothing. You walk through the doors, into an office.

The office was filled with knick-nacks, small statues, a handful of plaques and awards. Much of it memorabilia from old science fiction. The man ushered you both in, asked you to sit down. The seats were plush, and as you magnetically stuck to them you were met with a soft mesh to sink into, rather than the rigidness of most of the station's furniture.

"Thanks so much for waiting, I know we're just, way behind schedule here," he says. "I know I can get to talking. Forgive me?"

[[Yeah, it's no problem.]]
[[Let Sarah respond.]]

"Yeah, it's no problem," you say.

"Great! I'm very excited to see what both of you have come up with," he says. "Lay it on me!"


You look to Sarah, who responds. "Did you think we made any other plans today?" she asks genuinely. Ezra laughs.

"Just what I like to hear. I'm very excited to see what both of you have come up with," he says. "Lay it on me!"

[[Jump in.]]
[[Let Sarah start.]]

"We've developed a new kind of drone, something that can go under the surface of the ice here on Enceladus." Ezra's face looks intrigued, but confused.

"What, like, it can dig? Through the 30, 40 kilometers?"

"It doesn't need to dig," says Sarah. "It's designed to go through the openings from the geysers."


"We've designed a mission capable of searching for and retrieving biosamples from the ocean under the ice of Enceladus." Ezra's face looks intrigued, but confused.

"So, you're going to... dig? Through the 30, 40 kilometers?"

"It doesn't need to dig," says Sarah. "It's designed to go through the openings from the geysers."


"Okay. Yeah, that's cool. But... why? The whole point of us being here is the water comes right up to the surface, we grab the samples, and we're good. No need to dig."

[[Answer the question.]]
[[Let Sarah reply.]]





"The samples at the surface are almost always already dead. But, maybe there's something else in the ocean environment itself."


"Kid, you're the drone guy. Don't sweat it, but, let's stick to talking to our expertise."

[[And what's your expertise, exactly?]]


"Being the rich motherfucker who funds all this shit. Owns all this shit."

 He leans back in his chair. "Look, I get it. Your mom runs the station. Your dad's this generation's Einstein. Your grandma started this whole thing. And who am I, right? Buy a few stocks, suddenly I'm in charge.

Look. I'm not here to steal your gig. We all want the same thing here. Elevating our game. Like, humanity's game. We've all got something to bring to the table. I hear you're the best damn drone pilot we've got. That's an asset, yes it is. Sarah here, she's second only to your dad for astrobiology.

That's a team, right there. And you've got some good stuff you're talking to me about. And I'm here, listening. But I don't appreciate people trying to haul someone else's shit to the table. And I don't appreciate insolence.



My expertise is getting shit to happen. Getting us out there. With dollars, with pretty speeches, with some ass-whooping if I have to. You're... what, 20 something? You've got probably 80 to 100 years left of your life, assuming all goes well. That's nothing. Cosmically. I've got... half that.

I don't know about you, I want to get my ass to Proxima Centauri. I want to know if we're alone in the universe. I don't want to die, and be in heaven, and then see everyone figure all that shit out. If heaven's even a thing.

So, yeah. That's my job. Managing the little geniuses like you two is my job.

Now, this little microbial hunt seems kinda pointless, but what the hell. You're both smart. It's not that expensive. And maybe there is something down there. I'll give it to you. You've got the grant.

But, just know that's the easy part. You've intrigued me, now you need to impress me.

Good luck.






"It's like... we're trying to understand what a human looks like by collecting its dead skin cells. Now, it could be that's all there is, the ocean just has microbial remains. But I don't find that likely. We know there's hydrothermal vents, and we can see clear signs of life from these remains.





Both of you stand to leave, but hear Ezra call out as you pass the threshold.

"One last question: quantum-entanglement communications. Bullshit, or not?"

[[Sounds like bullshit.]]
[[It's legitimate research.]]
[[Why do you ask?]]

"Why do you ask?"

"Mr. Tweed Sweater, who you saw walking out. That was his deal. Wanted a lot of money. Can't read the guy... think he's bullshitting me, or no?"

[[Sounds like bullshit.]]
[[It's legitimate research.]]
















"I don't understand. The whole point of the station here is that we don't have to breach the ice. Samples travel up through the water. Why would we bother going through kilometers of ice when the geysers bring the material right to us?"


"By the time the water reaches the surface, 

There's only so much we can learn by continuing to collect more of thes." Sarah takes a breath. "We have to go under the ice, search for microbial life in the ocean floor." 


"Nothing we've seen indicates a second genesis. For all we know, the microbial remains we've found were transferred here by an asteroid... or even went to Earth to start life there. None of that tells us whether or not we're alone in the universe. 


"None of those could explain the quantum wave we detected. But it's... possible, something


"Microbes, they can live for... millions and millions of years. With little light, little oxygen.

The billowing of your habitat brought you out of your sleep today. The sound, first. The wind's whistle, far stronger than you'd felt it the day before. And the cloth, turbulent even from the inside. Your suit thrown about as you open your eyes. The habitat's constraints holding you to one side.

It takes a moment for your suit to adjust its temperature modulation systems accordingly. There's a crunch as your foot steps down on solid ice. Your boots need to dig into it slightly to stay secured to the floor.

The landscape is recognizable, but barely. There's still a shoreline. Thicker chunks of rock are mixed in with the sand. Some chunks of ice. The anchors of your habitats, placed close to the water's shore, are now partly frozen into the ground.

At first glance, there's no trace of the forest, only lifeless tundra. Soft particles of a frozen liquid hang in the air, buffeted by the wind toward the inland.

The frozen water stretches out before climbing to larger formations. The ice cliff-faces appear to be simple glaciers at first glance, but the longer you stare, you notice intricate and ornate structures. It's impossible to tell exactly what with the wind and alien snow.

"This was the doing of your father, before his premature death prior to your voyage. The drive he created is the most advanced piece of technology developed by humankind. Even he wouldn't be able to explain the source of the power, the microbes. Only that their properties allow space and time to fold, and thus be traversed at speeds impossible otherwise."

The patterns of your footsteps fall offbeat, each crunch adding a note to the chaos. It's hard to see, and though the suits keep you warm enough, the cold is still very much present. At the tips of your gloves. The ice at the edges of your helmet.

Everyone is silent, following Yusuf as he looks for the markings on the ice floor. The only sound the crunching of the ice. Hours pass. The glacial formations in the distance grow closer. It's not one solid glacier, you start to see gaps. The ice shifts and reflects. You keep walking toward it.

The sound of the crunches beneath your feet begin to change, reaching a higher pitch.

"I found my designation code, in my dream." Everyone focuses on you. "I know why we're here. There's a... microbe, or bacteria from this planet that operates the engine of our ship. It's the fuel. We're here to gather as much as we can, and bring it back. Then, they can use them to evacuate Earth, travel to a new home."

"Using... bacteria to power a spacecraft," says Sarah. "That's... genius."

"So... getting this drive to work is how we get home. And we do that by collecting bacteria?"

"We've been collecting samples of each biome the planet has presented us with," says Teeneese. "Sarah has documented what she understands to be microbial life from each of these environments. Isn't that enough?"

"That's why we need to go back to the ship, so we can compare to the database there and find out if these are the microbes we're looking for."

"My goal is to find Joshua," says Yusuf. "But, these tracks lead in the same direction of the ship. We'll go together."

Sarah occasionally will take a sample of the soil. Once you reach what was once the edge of the forest, there's the occasional fossilized sign of a tree. Circular branches etched into rock, preserved by snow and ice. Ringlets of what now seems ancient, and yet was yesterday.

"These remains... they should be millions of years old," says Sarah. "The samples of bark we took yesterday were... thousands at most."

More of these fossilized remains appear the further you go into the forest. They're not all branches, some are the imprints of leaves. You and Sarah spread out, walking among the mummified corpses of the trees.

Sarah is leaning over what at first looks like another one of the fossilized trees. It takes a moment before you notice the lines in the rock resemble a face, certain crevices the edge of a cheek, a knot round like an eye. Jagged teeth lodged inside.

You see the components, but their no longer shaped the right way. They rotate about each other, as if someone had spun a face around and around and around until it was a soup, and then frozen it in rock.

There's a moment when you don't recognize the shapes as that of your sister where you think it might be beautiful. The moment passes and only the nausea remains.

Listening closely, you hear an echoing ping appearing consistently. They seem to match Yusuf's boots as they drag.

"And I suppose you want to use my drone?" says Yusuf, with a scowl.

"It's technically not your drone, just because you're carrying it," says Sarah.

Yusuf pulls out a small disk shape from his pack, places it carefully into the air. There's a semi-circular strip he pulls off of one end, which snaps into a control mechanism.

Yusuf swerves his arms, and the drone follows. Leaning his hands forward, the drone moves towards the opening.

He opens a visual feed, projected between the two controls in his hand, showing the view from the drone. You watch over Yusuf's shoulder.

He lowers his arms, directing the drone down into the water. You watch as the barren landscape of the surface transforms into a dazzling cascade of lights, shining through the light into the water below. It's beautiful, even though the light is dim.

"Let's collect these samples and move on," says Yusuf.

"Go deeper," says Sarah. "If there's a floor not to far, we're much more likely to find biological material there."

Yusuf sighs and directs the drone lower into the water. There's less light, the further the drone goes down, but not many other changes. But the view begins to shake the deeper the drone goes, making it nearly impossible to see anything clearly.

"Why are you moving it like that?" she asks.

"I'm-- I'm not!" Yusuf replies. "It's the current, it's--"

The screen freezes and then goes black. "We have lost connection to the drone," says CINDI.

"Perfect. Great idea for a detour. I'm going to find Joshua."

Yusuf's already forging ahead, and the rest follow. There are more holes, but you avoid them this time. They seem to grow smaller, thinner as you approach the structures in the distance. Soon, they're gone altogether, and the ice is flat. It seems bluer than before, thinner perhaps. Teeneese takes a step, and leaves a crack in the ice. After that, everyone walks more carefully. Joshua must have as well, the prints became more and more faint. But Yusuf still manages to hold onto the trail.

The structures rose, large and rounded pillars. Once you reached the base of the first, they grew even stranger. Each was slightly different than the other. The first were small, but soon grew larger and more complex. Some were rough, others perfectly smooth. Some with a base, others lodged into the ground. But they all held an eerily familiar oval shape, like a stretched out skipping stone.

The structures seemed to all be concentrating to one spot, circling out from there. As you got closer, it looked as if what was at that central point was just another one of the pillars. But beneath the ice, there was a silver shine. Long legs stretched out from it to keep it stable. It was your ship, coated in ice, but clearly there.

You ask Yusuf to let you control the drone, and he asks why.

[[Because I'm better at it than you.]]

"Because I'm better at it than you." The controls are easy to slip out from Yusuf's gloves, and hold with yours. There's barely a stutter as you take control. Yusuf scoffs, and begins to walk away, telling you he's going to go find Joshua. Teeneese goes with him, and Sarah stays behind with you to investigate the hole.

As you approach the ship, you think back to that first night, the shallow water, the twin moons. Looking up, clouds obscure most of the sky. 

"CINDI, open the airlock." There's a roar as the ship's gears shift, breaking away the ice coating the underbelly of the ship. The doors open directly above you.

[[Jump onto the ship.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="643" name="Jump onto the ship." tags="" position="64660,160">You push up from the ground, detaching, and fly up into the airlock. As soon as you pass the threshold, you feel warmer and more at ease, even as you crash into the closed blast doors on the opposite side of the airlock. Soon, you grab hold of the handle there and steady yourself. Looking to the side, you see Sarah's done the same.

"We're in, CINDI," she says. You hear the rumble again, as the doors close.

You reorient yourself, placing your feet on solid ground to face the doors. The compartment is flooded with breathable air, decompressing gas, and toxins to preserve the environment within the ship. Soon, the inward doors open, and you're inside once more.

It's the same as you left it. The pods, still there, either empty or filled with corpses. The stale beauty of "brand new" after drifting through space time. Sarah rushes over to the computers, already looking for the data you need.

She looks calm, rested. So different from the face you've seen in your memories. Her hair cut down close to her scalp. Eyelids gently folded down. Lips relaxed, her neck sinking into the padding of the cryo chamber.

Confusion. Nothing crossed her face. Still serene.

The glass opens, and a stale smell wafts up. You see her arms tucked in at her side, strapped down inside the chamber. It's strange, how still she is. Bodies are never that still.

Carefully, you weave between the holes in the ice. They vary in size, some barely visible. But they all seem to stretch deep towards something below.






They were round ovals of ice, 















It looked as if the sheet of ice were a strip of paint, and someone had taken a brush to lift up globs of it, sweeping up and painted across the air. Thin strips connected to other rising globs creating a network of paths. Deeper into the structure, the connections became thicker and thicker, as if they were a web. 





















The force pushes you towards the water below. You try and grab onto something to stop the fall on your way down, but the spikes in your arm slice through the ice of the glacier you hit against. Nothing sticks.

Your head is spinning, rotating between seeing the sky of clouds and ice and the light blue liquid coming closer and closer until

Sarah nods, and continues towards the ship. You run after Yusuf and Teeneese.

The footprints weave through the forest of ice formations, leading you away from the ship. As you walk close to them, you notice entrances at the base of some of the ice structures. Some are sizable holes at its base, others doors or windows several feet up.

"Here," says Yusuf, coming to a stop. "The tracks stop here, and point towards that thing." He points at a nearby ice structure. It's particularly round on the outside, with an opening close to the ground. Inside, you see hints of ornate patterns, corridors, and open spaces.

Yusuf walks directly below it, under the opening, and jumps up towards it. He tries to grab an edge of the opening, but can't hold onto the ice. "Shit," he says, as he moves towards the ceiling.

"Idiot," says Teeneese. She follows, but activates the spikes of her gloves, allowing her to easily grab hold of the ice and carefully pull herself inside the structure.

Once you're inside, it's surprising how easily you're able to navigate the interior. It all feels oddly natural. Round corridors that open up into larger spaces. It's not that there was a clear pattern, if anything, the structure was objectively a maze. But it was one you had an intuition for, Yusuf especially. But his concentration didn't waver to admire the ice sculpture's architecture. Instead, he was looking for any sign of a dent in the smooth ice, a sign someone else had traveled through the space in a Proxima suit.

But before anyone saw him, there was his voice. ""?????

It's not from the comms, so you know he must be close. It's hard to tell where, the sound must be bouncing off the tunnels of ice. Yusuf looks up, and your eyes follow. There's what looks like a shadow hovering on the other side of the ice above you, four spots. Two sets of footprints.

"He's there." Yusuf moves down the corridor, looking for a way up there.

"Say something!" you hear Joshua scream. "Fucking say something!"


It's the same silhouette you saw in the desert. In this closed space, it looks strangely less imposing. The shape vaguely human, as before, still shifting. It looks more like an oddly shaped storm cloud than anything.

Joshua is at the other side of what is large spherical space, one opening you and your crew came through, and another at the other end. There's another at the ceiling. Other than that, the surface is perfectly smooth. His eyes look past the figure facing him, and find all of you.

"What did you do to him?" Joshua spits the words at Yusuf, ignoring the rest of you. "I thought your machines killed him, but this... it's worse."


The figure seems to fold into itself, and once it folds out, it appears as Ana Dandara.

Once you're inside, it's surprising how easily you're able to navigate the interior. It all feels oddly natural. Round corridors that open up into larger spaces. It's not that there was a clear pattern, if anything, the structure was objectively a maze. But it was one you had an intuition for, Yusuf especially. But his concentration didn't waver to admire the ice sculpture's architecture. Instead, he was looking for any sign of a dent in the smooth ice, a sign someone else had traveled through the space in a Proxima suit.

But before anyone saw him, there was his voice. ""?????

It's not from the comms, so you know he must be close. It's hard to tell where, the sound must be bouncing off the tunnels of ice. Yusuf looks up, and your eyes follow. There's what looks like a shadow hovering on the other side of the ice above you, four spots. Two sets of footprints.

"He's there." Yusuf moves down the corridor, looking for a way up there.

"Say something!" you hear Joshua scream. "Fucking say something!"


It's the same silhouette you saw in the desert. In this closed space, it looks strangely less imposing. The shape vaguely human, as before, still shifting. It looks more like an oddly shaped storm cloud than anything.

Joshua is at the other side of what is large spherical space, one opening you and your crew came through, and another at the other end. There's another at the ceiling. Other than that, the surface is perfectly smooth. His eyes look past the figure facing him, and find all of you.

"What did you do to him?" Joshua spits the words at Yusuf, ignoring the rest of you. "I thought your machines killed him, but this... it's worse."


The figure seems to fold into itself, and once it folds out, it appears as Ana Dandara.

[[Mom, is that you?]]
[[You're not my mother.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="663" name="Mom, is that you?" tags="" position="66660,160">"Mom, is that you?" The figures eyes meet yours. Curious.

"You're not my mother." The figures eyes meet yours. Curious.

(if alive) Joana walks forward. "Uncle Amarizio..."

"That's... it's my dad." He turns to you. Teeneese's face is frozen, eyes more reflective as they take on light tears, fists clenched but still shaking.

All you see is the face of your mother, just as she sat in cryo, 

"It's... not him, is it?" There's a strange mix of relief and pain on Joshua's face.

[[Not who?]]
[[It's alien.]]
[[It's an illusion.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="664" name="Not who?" tags="" position="66760,160">"Not who?" you ask Joshua, but his eyes are focused on the figure.

"We're each seeing someone important to us. He must be seeing... someone we left behind," says Yusuf. "Whoever it is, it's not him, Josh." 

"Then fuck off, will you?" Joshua runs towards the figure. "Just fuck off!"

The figure that looked like Ana takes a step back, and then fades back into cloud, dissipating into the atmosphere into what looks like nothing. It seems quieter, now, though you can't tell what noise disappeared. Yusuf exhales the oxygen he's been holding in his lungs.

"God. What were you thinking?" He turns to Joshua. "That thing could have hurt you. It's a miracle we found you at all. We have to stick together."

"Don't need this. Don't need this right now." Eyes are shut tight, back turned.

"Yes. Yes you do." Yusuf walks over to him, grabbing and turning his shoulders to face forward. "My first responsibility is towards your life. Above this mission, above my own. You're my brother, and I keep you safe. I bring you home."

"I'm not sure what memories you've been recovering, Yusuf. But they must be very different than mine. If you think I hold love for you in my heart. You made my life hell. You're not a brother, you took my father away from me. You're a thief."

"No, don't. Don't blame me for his actions. I protected you from--"

"Elliot. Elliot was his name. The person I saw, that I thought I followed here. Snuffed out by CINDI before we even got here, to keep the rest of you breathing. God, and you don't even remember. We were just going to... stay here, no matter what. Not go back. Every time I sleep, it's him. Even if dad's there, tormenting me, it melts away so quickly. It turns to him...

He seems bewildered as he's hit by it, grazing his suit and opening up a wound. Toxic air immediately rushes in. Joshua's pulse still fires, hitting the ice near Yusuf's feat. The structure begins to shake as there's increasingly strained breathing.

Joshua lifts from the floor, floating and fighting to keep a straight face as his lungs gasp for oxygen, filling themselves with (???). But there's little pain, other than that. The occasional smile pushes through and, once the gasping is done, that's all that remains.

"What... did you do." His voice is lower than you heard it before. He stands. Eyes lock in at you. "What did you..." He's running at you as fast as the suit can take him.

"Floating over an endless pit, yeah I see." It stretches down further than you can see.

"Get me back to solid ground. Now." It stretches down further than you can see.


"Yusuf, use your drone," says Joana. Only now does Yusuf turn, and see you floating over the precipice.

(if good rel) "Oh, shit. I'm on it." (if bad rel) "Watch your step. Idiot." He pulls out a small disk shape from his pack, places it carefully into the air. There's a semi-circular strip he pulls off of one end, which snaps into a control mechanism.

Yusuf swerves his arms, and the drone follows. Leaning his hands forward, the drone moves across the chasm towards you, reaching close enough for you to grab hold of it.

"Now pull him back," says Joana.

"No wait," says Sarah. "We could use the drone, to see what's down there." She points into the hole in the ice. (if good rel) "Only if you feel comfortable."

[[Pull me back.]]
[[Send me down.]]
[[Have the drone go on its own.]]

"Pull me back," you say. "I'm not going down there."

The drone reverses course, dragging you behind it. Soon, there's solid ice beneath your feet, and you let go.

[[Thanks, Yusuf.]]
[[Could have warned me.]] (?)

"Thanks, Yusuf." You pat him on the shoulder before continuing on the trail of footsteps.

"Could have warned me."

He opens a visual feed, projected between the two controls in his hand, showing the view from the drone. You watch over Yusuf's shoulder.

You ask Yusuf to let you control the drone, and he asks why.

[[Because I'm better at it than you.]]
[[In case you want to go ahead and find Joshua.]]

"Because I'm better at it than you." The controls are easy to slip out from Yusuf's gloves, and hold with yours. There's barely a stutter as you take control. Yusuf scoffs, and begins to walk away, telling you he's going to go find Joshua. Teeneese goes with him, and Sarah stays behind with you to investigate the hole.

"In case you want to go ahead and find Joshua." Yusuf nods, handing over the controls to you. They slip off his fingers and onto yours with ease, there's barely a stutter as you take control. Yusuf and Teeneese continue, and you and Sarah stay behind to investigate the hole.

You hear him first. Shrill, high pitched. "You shouldn't be here! Why are you here!"

It's not from the comms, so you know he must be close. It's hard to tell where, the sound must be bouncing off the tunnels of ice. Yusuf looks up, and your eyes follow. There's what looks like a shadow hovering on the other side of the ice above you, four spots. Two sets of footprints.

"He's there." Yusuf moves down the corridor, looking for a way up there.

"Say something!" you hear Joshua scream. "Fucking say something!"




But you're accelerating towards the surface.




The force pushes you towards the water below. You try and grab onto something to stop the fall on your way down, but the spikes in your arm slice through the ice of the glacier you hit against. Nothing sticks.

You're surprised by how easily you're able to navigate the interior. It all feels oddly natural. The voices still echo from above you, and you find another path leading you up closer to them.

Once the ice levels out again, you see the haze of two figures from the other side of the ice. One's holding something, all you can see is hazy outlines. But you think it must be the guitar, it must be Joshua.

"It's you, of course its you." The voice echoes through the ice with sharp precision. It was Joshua.

Ornate:



What looked like indentations to a flat surface from afar now appear fully three dimensional. Carvings dig deep, some scaling up in what looks like they could be steps.

The ice gleams. Even in the dark and gray. The little light there is is sprinkled everywhere. There's small holes littered throughout, spiraling throughout. The holes aren't rigid, like those earlier. It's as if a whirlpool was frozen in the midst of its rotation. Multiplied throughout and strewn about. 






Each was slightly different than the other. Some were rough, others perfectly smooth. Some with a base, others lodged into the ground. But they all held an eerily familiar oval shape, like a stretched out skipping stone.

"Ana! Ana Dandara de Silva. Volta aqui. Agora."

There's a young girl, hands stretched out, face towards the sky. Toes tickled by the water.

"Estava procurando voce todo dia. E agora, voce esta aqui na praia? Preciso seu ajuda. Estamos todos preparando para festa hoje a noite, para natal."

There's a mother, lifting her dress to walk across the beach sand in her bare feet.

"Tem alguma coisa para falar?"

[[Cuidado com os tatui's.]]
[[Quero ficar aqui na praia.]]

"Cuidado com os tatui's." Her right hand is lightly buried in the moist sand, head turned and watching as the small sand crabs walk between her fingers, occasionally getting the courage to crawl onto the top of her hand. "Voce anda aqui sem pensar sobre eles."

"Solmente e um bichinho," she says.

"Porque um bichinho nao e importante?" the girl responds. "Nao estou falando que nois precisa salvar todos os bichinos nesse praia, mais para olhar antes de colocar seu pe no chao nao e dificil."

"Ta certo," she says. "Voce ta completamente certo. Vem aqui."

The waves of the beach come and come again, bringing more creatures to shore and returning others to the ocean. The mother sits down next to her daughter, helping her lean up against her.

"Voce lembra a historia de seu nome?"

[[Me conta de novo.]]

"Nao vamo ficar aqui muti tempo mais."

"Acho que nao." The mother leans down, and holds her tight. "Mais, vamo aproveitar."

She lifts her daughter, and walks back towards the house near the shore, through the sand and snow. Glancing down when she can, so not to disturb the creatures burying themselves deep into the Earth, hiding from the cold. And from everything still to come.

"It's just a sand crab," she says.

"And why isn't a sandcrab important?" the little girl responds. "I'm not saying we need to save every little creature on this beach, but to look before you put down your foot isn't difficult."

[[Tell me again.]]
[[I don't remember.]]

"Your name is Ana Dandara de Silva. Ana was the name of my mom. Silva was the family name of your dad, one of the few things he left with us, after leaving one night. But, your name isn't Ana de Silva."

She liked this part of the story.

"Yes, just like you. Free and powerful."


"Warrior of what?"

"Of free people, like you and me. People once taken from home, put on boats, forced to build a new world for their captures. But Dandara helped them build a place for themselves."

Sarah's calls of anguish only become more amplified, as images begin to cross your mind. It takes a moment to adjust, having an environment projected directly to your headspace. Closing your eyes helps, and the world around you starts to take shape.

Everything's red. Barren. The water behind you, dried up. Vegetation demolished. The sand is congealed and rocky. Even though you're simply looking at images through Sarah's eyes, you can sense the head they hold. Sarah's hands, appearing in front of your line of sight, keep switching where they lay on the floor to keep her from completely collapsing on the floor.

And then she turns up, and you see it. A whip of fire across the sky. Plasma closer than anyone should ever wish to see it, stretching out as if it were touching the atmosphere. Proxima Centauri always takes up much of the sky, but this is different.

"Oh god." It's the first time you've ever heard CINDI mention god before. "It's a solar flare."

The plasma stretches out from the dark red sun, pulsing with energy. Then, Sarah's view falls back towards the rocky ground. You only hear her heavy breathing and guttural grunts as she looks for somewhere safe to hide.

"I am connecting to the data stored locally in her CINDI chipset. She is storing thoughts in the hope to communicate to you.

"Solar flares. They have come back. We are dying. I meant to tell you. They come, not often, but enough. Suits can't stop all the radiation. We are dying."

Eyes open, and you're back on the riverbank. The soft trickle of water as it meanders down tickling your ears. It's this same place, this land, a few thousands of years later, that will be transformed into a coffin for your friends. You think, how can I then say time has no meaning? Time, that can demolish mountains, soak up rivers, unleash horrors.

Well. Time has only the power you give it.

"Please help," Sarah thinks, as radiation poisons her insides. She hopes that CINDI is transferring these messages from her mind to you, but she barely understands quantum-communications as is, without the time travel involved. And yet, she holds on hope, without a plan, or even understanding of how it could be done. But the thought reaches you, thousands of years in the past.

Either here or in epilogue:

Aftermath of your change


Need to have something to pull you back!!!!

Same way microbe's connectedness allowed it to take you back to planet, you (or someone) needs to be able to latch onto something back home to take you there.






















You are all soaked in blood. You are all guilty, of crimes past and future. Of crimes present.





This notion of choice. It appears throughout your language, your thinking. We do not fully understand this concept. But you claim it can correct past wrongs. It can divert those of the future.

Remember, these terms are foreign to us. We do not believe this to be possible.

However, we shall give you the chance to
























"You can't punish us for something we haven't done yet."

There is no yet. You are doing it now. You have already done it. You will do it.

We understand this is difficult for you. But even within your limited linearity we are attempting to grasp, this is true. Your actions now create that future. Your choices of the past have led you to this point. You cannot separate them.

Our destruction / Your violence is now. It is then. It is next.

And we should be clear. This is not punishment. This is not a concept we contain. We are stating truths, that is all there is. 




















"We need to go back home."

"And what the fuck is that?" Voice rings in the chamber. "You keep saying we need to go back home. They keep saying the same thing. God, I wish I could. I wish I knew where that place was. 











Goals for end time travel stuff:

1) We never should have come here
	- not have proxima created
	- never find microbe / create drive
	- permanently cripple earth

2) We need to get the fuel back to earth
	- send back precise mapping of planet to ensure mission success (plant in og cindi core?)
	- use time travel stuff as distraction while collecting samples to go back
	- somehow bring ship underground? Idk

3) Only use enough to go back home
	- use already collected samples
	- do any time travel? idk


4) Build drive safely / cooperatively
	- on their terms: all engineers must be "symbiotic"
	- go back, try to explain to issac, ana, ezra
	- further: go back to ezol, change basic structure of org


5) Stay on planet
	- can't go back + cause more violence
	- have to stay and live here, keep survival of "human" species
	- continuing to effect and change environment































Potential brainstorming for the big nexus scene:


A kind of "judgement day," all past actions get brought up
What kind of notion of "law" or "justice" would a non-linear species have?

(thinking about how part of colonialism is discounting the laws / forms of governance / forms of community / accountability in those places)

Makes impact of previous parts of the story more important

This somehow works in with a kind of "limited" amount of memories to go back to

Here, at the end, I see you. For the first time, I think.

I see all the possible versions of you, of us. Worlds that could have been. Some, terrifying. Others, beautiful. Most are in between. And I... miss all of them, all at once. As I see you fading away.

Each and every one of you I know is still with me. Will be with me, a part of me. And yet, there is something about linearity, about the end of a line, even as it branches and loops and ends and begins. There's a profound sadness to what you call death.

Even with these suits, your body reek of life. There is no way to quarantine yourselves. It only represents an attempt at... what is your word for it? Ah, perhaps plausabile deniability.

"Yes, we came to this place. But we didn't change it. We wore fancy costumes to protect the environment. To protect ourselves."

Does that sound right?

This choice was made. You are here. Already, we feel parts of ourselves being skinned off. There are new pieces, too. These... words. They are strange. They flow from one side of the page to the other. This is new to us. Beginnings and endings... it is a fascinating fiction you have created for yourselves.

[[How can you... communicate so well?]]


This is... what you call communication? Attempts at uttering syllables, constructing letters? Interesting. There are far more complex systems at play within your organic form than the feeble means you have to understand each other. And we have mastered an understanding of these as well, in the short time you have been here.


[[Let me go. Let me have your mind.]]

You say this as if I hold you. As if we asked for this. For you to come here. I have no choice in the matter, truly, it is all yours.
















LATER:


"How were you able to uncover all this?"

It's all there, inside you. In your bones, your blood, your gut. Stories held by all the life that lives in those places.

I sense a preoccupation with the mind as the site of what you call memory. These bodies of yours... they are wondrous hosts to so much more than the gray matter of your minds. They are systems that carry knowledge and meaning in every crevice, whether you choose to listen to them or not.

We see all this, and all we do is listen.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="845" name="Chapter 4 backup" tags="" position="85010,110">"Please." You played the voice back in your mind.

"Be good."

"Please." The voice was different now. Tasted metallic.

"Wake up."

"Please." Eyes open. Moth gasps in artificial oxygen.

Your helmet, half buried in sand blowing over the glass of your helmet. Clouds in the sky, between the grains of sand being thrown at the canvas of the world by wind. And the red. The trees. Great leaves, riddled with webbed patterns. Light sprinkling down on you, lighting up the sand covering your sight, turning it into gold.

The sand shifts, rolling to one side. There's the sound of wind. You can feel it, in the tips of your fingers poking out from underneath the blanket of the sand. Even through the gloves. Somehow, this all feels familiar.

[[Brush away the sand.]]
[[Sit up.]]

You lift your arms from under the comfort of the grains of sand, and listen as the grains are thrust into the sky. Using a free hand, you swipe away the remaining grains from your helmet, sending them into the air as well, bringing the world above you into view.

From the ground, the wooden branches spiral. Their knotted together, it's impossible to tell where they begin and end. The wood is a light pink, the leaves a deep red. Your eyes sink into what almost looks like velvet growing off of the branches. Soft. Fluid. Your eyes are captivated upwards as you sit up, sand falling from your body.

There's stringy roots mixed together with the branches, rising up from the ground, connecting all the trunks among themselves, like webbing. This continues all the way up into what looks like a canopy, where the velvet leaves overtake the branches and roots.



You lift your arms from under the comfort of the grains of sand, and listen as the grains are thrust into the sky. Using your free hands, you push your torso upright. The sand covering your body floats into the air in front of you, in a cloud. The world around you comes into view.

Thin roots in front of you sprawl up from the ground, connecting to thick trunks floating above. They look like silver, graying hairs. Knotted and unkept, barely securing the trees to the sand that still stretches out endlessly before you. Looking through the mess of strings, it's impossible to see what's on the other side.

The wood of the trunks is a light pink, the leaves hanging down a deep red. Your eyes sink into what almost looks like velvet growing off of the branches. Soft. Fluid. Your eyes follow them up, and you see the branches and roots spiral above you. This continues all the way up into what looks like a canopy, where the velvet leaves overtake the branches and roots.

"$name? Are you there?" It's Sarah's voice. "Your vitals just came online. Where are you?"

[[I... don't know.]]
[[In some kind of forest, or jungle.]]
[[I saw my mom. She was here.]]

"I... don't know."

"Well, that doesn't help us much, does it? Just, describe your surroundings."

[[I'm under... floating trees.]]
[[I'm surrounded by velvet leaves.]]

"I'm under... floating trees."

"I'm surrounded by velvet leaves."

"Oh, good. You can't be too far, then."


"In some kind of forest, or jungle."

"Oh, good. You can't be too far, then.


"I saw my mom. She was here."

"We've all been... seeing strange things. Yusuf's been inspecting our suits, making sure nothing from the planet's air has infected our air or water supply."

[[Yeah, we must be seeing things.]]
[[No, she was here. We touched.]]

"Yeah, we must be seeing things."

"Can you describe where you are to me?


"No, she was here. We touched."

"We can talk about it when you get back. Can you describe where you are to me?"

[[I'm under... floating trees.]]
[[I'm surrounded by velvet leaves.]]

"I'm under... floating trees."

"I'm surrounded by velvet leaves."

"Oh, good. You can't be too far, then."


[[You can see these trees too?]]
[[I can't be close. Everything I saw yesterday was flat.]]

"You can see these trees too?"

"Yes. Just like the night before, when we woke up, everything was different. We're in the same place, but it's... changed."


"I can't be close. Everything I saw yesterday was flat."

"Just like the night before, when we woke up, everything was different. We're in the same place, but it's... changed."

[[Trees don't grow overnight.]]
[[Life must grow on this planet... incredibly fast.]]

"Trees don't grow overnight." You turn around, and see the vast desert stretch out behind you. Some of the formations you recognize from yesterday.

"But they did."


"Life must grow on this planet... incredibly fast." You turn around, and see the vast desert stretch out behind you. Some of the formations you recognize from yesterday.

"I have some theories. We're still trying to explain it."

[[You don't think we did this, did you?]]
[[This planet's evolution must be accelerated.]]

"You don't think we did this, do you? Our suits are sealed and sterilized."

"Joshua's suit broke. Something... could have come out."

[[Shit.]]
[[That can't be it.]]


"This planet's evolution must be accelerated."

"It's possible. Samples we've taken from the bark seem to have the same basic components as the microbial life we found germinating at the shoreline, yesterday. But... the mutations required should have taken thousands of years."

[[We really don't know anything, do we?]]
[[Then that can't be it.]]


"Based on CINDI's location data and your description, my guess is you're on the other side of the forest from us. Just go straight through, and you should be close to where we set up camp by the coastline."

[[Has anyone else been... in the forest?]]
[[What if you're wrong?]]
[[Okay, I'll make my way through.]]

"Has anyone else been... in the forest?"

"Well... no, not exactly. We've collected samples from its edge, but no one's been inside. You'll be the first."

[[Oh, excellent.]]
[[Well, wish me luck.]]


"What if you're wrong?"

"Then you're just as lost as you are right now."


"Okay, I'll make my way through."

"If you can, try and take some samples. We only got some of the bark."


You start to move forward, towards the trees.

"Also, there's... one more thing. Your sister... she isn't back yet. / (Teeneese), she isn't back yet."

[[I'll find her.]]
[[She'll find her way back.]]
[[You only tell me this now?]]

"I'll find her." You speak with strength, to convince yourself its true.

"Okay. I'm... sure you will." The comms go silent, and you're left with the trees above you.


"She'll find her way back." You speak with certainty, to convince yourself its true.

"Okay. I'm... sure she well." The comms go silent, and you're left with the trees above you.
 

"You only tell me this now?" There's an anger beneath your words.

(if + rel) "I was-- we thought we lost both of you. I'm just glad you're okay. If you see any sign of her, follow it if you can." The comms go silent, and you're left with the trees above you.

(if - rel) "I was-- just trying to stay focused on the mission. Now you know." The comms go silent, and you're left with the trees above you.


The only sound is that of a wind rushing through the leaves, the roots and branches. It's the only other sound besides your own breathing, loud inside your helmet. No chirping, no birds calling. You can't remember being in a forest before, but those feel like sounds that should be here. But aren't.

In front of you lies more sand, with the strands of roots hanging down. This path would be easier to traverse, though give you less chances to see/explore the environment. Moving higher towards the canopy would be easy in the low gravity, though moving through the forest might be more difficult. But, if there is more to see, it likely would be there.

You wonder where Joana/Teeneese traveled, which path she took. Perhaps she was still in the desert, behind you. It's hard to know where best to go to find her.

[[Look back to the desert.]]
[[Travel through the trees.]]
[[Walk on the ground.]]

You turn back to the desert. It looks much like before, though the wind kicks up dust and leaves small tunnels of sand move through the landscape. The same formations lie in the distance, but there's no figure this time. She's moved on from here. No sign of Joana either.

"The temperature in the desert environment appears to be far above safe parameters. I do not recommend returning," says CINDI.

[[What if Joana is out there?]]
[[Don't worry, I won't.]]

"What if Joana is out there?"

"If they are, it is too late for them."

"Don't worry, I wont."

You turn back to the forest.

[[Travel through the trees.]]
[[Walk on the ground.]]

(in trees)

You crouch, then thrust your body up, giving enough energy for your boots to unstick from the sand. The world starts to move as the tangled branches grow closer and closer, the floor and wispy roots sinking away. Rushing closer and closer to you is a branch, stretching out from one of the thick trunks, and a root, dangled between two trunks.

[[Grab hold of the branch.]]
[[Grab hold of the root.]]

As a branch approaches, you stretch out your hand, and grab hold of it. Your grasp is loose, but something from the surface of your glove helps you hold on. Once you stabilize, and pull yourself up to the branch, you see small spikes emerged from your hand, lodging themselves into the tree.

[[Neat.]]
[[That's going to leave a mark.]]

"Neat." The grip on the branch allows you to pull yourself upright, and then lodge your other hand into the trunk of the tree.


"That's going to leave a mark." The grip on the branch allows you to pull yourself upright.

"Better the mark be left in the branch than a tear in your suit," says CINDI. "However, I can remove your suits "grapple spikes" (find better name) if you prefer."

[[No, leave them.]]
[[Yes, deactivate them.]]

"No, leave them." You lodge your other hand into the trunk of the tree, letting your feet rest lightly on the branch.

"Yes, deactivate them." The spikes retract and you quickly grasp the branch with your hand, awkwardly clambering towards the trunk of the tree.


A leaf floats towards you. Not down, just past. The wind makes it dance, the deep red reflecting the rays of light breaking through the canopy. It looks like it's swimming. Everything does. The roots dance and tease the branches, the branches sway the leaves and the leaves ruffle with the gusts of wind and spill their color out. Looking back to the desert, you see the leaves trail off into the distance.

[[You wish things would just stay the same.]]
[[You found something intoxicating about all the change.]]

You wish things would just stay the same. That the desert could stay just a desert, at least. Shadows could just be shadows. Roots stay in the ground. But you know this world will only get stranger before all this is over.

You found something intoxicating about all the change. The world dynamic, evolving around you. Each day something strange and beautiful and terrifying. There was some rhythm, to the shifting landscapes, the strange appearances. You hope to learn its beat before all this is over.


There's another gust of wind as you turn back to the forest. Joana must be inside, somewhere. And everyone else, on the other side. In between, an impossible number of questions to be answered.

[[Go straight into the forest.]]
[[Go into the forest to the right.]]
[[Go into the forest to the left.]]

Grabbing a branch or root and pulling forward is the least obnoxious method of moving through the environment you found. It almost felt like swinging through the environment in slow motion. But after one long jump between a branch and a root, you slip.

You grab for a branch to hold you still, but it slips from your fingers. You continue to spin, and your legs hit a nearby trunk. The edge of your boot easily slices through the wood. A white puss bubbles out from the gash, sticking to your boot.

[[Try and wipe the material from your boot.]]
[[Take a sample of the material.]]
[[Move on, just leave the material there.]]

You try and wipe the material off your boot, but it sticks to your gloves as well. The puss seems to solidify, drying up and caking itself onto the outside of your suit. 

You pull out a sample collection tool from your pack, and hold it close to the side of your shoe. It sucks in some drops of the material and then seals tight. You return the tool to your pack.

You continue on, leaving the material on your shoe.

[[Continue going straight.]]
[[Continue going up.]]
[[Continue going down.]]

There's a small clearing you see ahead of you. A trunk thicker than most. But as the trunk rises, it splinters off into smaller and smaller branches, stretching up. These don't circle about like the others. In fact, it seems many of them have woven themselves through the surrounding circular branches. They splinter and splinter upwards into the canopy beyond your line of sight.

[[Continue on.]]
[[Deploy a drone.]]

You push forward, until there's a pinging coming from your suit.


From your pack, you pull out the portable drone and deploy it. As it ascends higher and higher above the tree, you notice the higher you go, the more wood appears to be charred. It's not as if there was a fire. Instead, it appears as if some of the branches simply have gone rotten. The drone maneuvers to look at the structure from above, revealing a pile of leaves in a central corridor created by the branches near the center of the structure.

[[Take samples of the charred wood.]]
[[Take samples of the leaves.]]
[[Don't take any samples.]]

The drone goes to one of the charred branches, and 

"Based on your distance traveled, I believe the forest's exit will be within range of the drone's communication. I will set it to search for an exit route."

[[Thank you.]]
[[I didn't ask for that.]]

"Thank you." 

"I didn't ask for that."

You push forward, until there's a pinging coming from your suit.


[[What is that?]]
[[Turn that off!]]

"What is that?"

"Turn that off!"

"Captain/$name, that's a close proximity emergency beacon," says CINDI. "It must be coming from your sister."

[[Where is she?]]
[[Is she okay?]]

"Where is she?"

"Nearby. I can direct you to her."

"Is she okay?"

"Her vitals seem stable, but brain activity is far more active than it should be. I can direct you to her."

Directions appear on the inside of your helmet, pointing you towards a nearby tree trunk, at the transition point between the lower roots and more diverse midsection. You see her, slumped up against the tree. Legs hovering above the ground. The white puss is everywhere, out of a root stuck to her thigh. Something is wrong. Joana's eyes are closed.

[[Joana, it's me.]]
[[CINDI, what's wrong with her?]]
[[Shake her shoulder.]]

"Joana, it's me." Slowly, you see her eyelids begin to lift beneath her suit helmet.

"$name? This is... I don't understand. I wasn't here. I was somewhere else."


"CINDI, what's wrong with her?"

"It appears she is unconscious, but stable. I will attempt to reconnect to her suit, and bring her to consciousness." Slowly, you see her eyelids begin to lift beneath her suit helmet.

"$name? This is... I don't understand. I wasn't here. I was somewhere else."


You reach out and hold her shoulder, and gently push. Slowly, you see her eyelids begin to lift beneath her suit helmet.

"$name? This is... I don't understand. I wasn't here. I was somewhere else."


[[Where were you?]]
[[You're back now.]]
[[What happened?]]

"Where were you?" 

"I was on a beach shore. I think... mom was there. It was snowing."

[[I've been seeing mom too.]]
[[Snowing? On a beach?]]
[[Must have been another dream.]]

"I've been seeing mom too." She looked up to you.

"Did she say anything?"

[[I don't think so.]]
[[She said to be good.]]

"I don't think so."

"She said to be good."

"Helpful advice."


"Must have been another dream."

"Maybe."



"You're back now." 

(if good rel) "I-- okay." You saw her take a breath in. "I'm back. I'm just... scared."
(if bad rel) "Back? Back to where?" Her eyes dart back up at you. "I'm scared. Don't try and comfort me, because I should be scared. You should be scared."

[[I'm scared too.]]
[[Fear is weakness.]]

"I'm scared too." Something melted between you, a tension soothing from the admittance of fear.

"So. We're both fucking terrified, and I'm stuck to a weirdass alien root." Her eyes soften. "What's next?"


"Fear is weakness." The words came softly, and something tightened between you. "We can't let it consume us."

"Fear isn't something you can fight, $name." Her eyes sink back. "I don't know what we do next."


"What happened?"

"Cut in my suit. There was a cut in my suit." Her eyes moved back and forth, as if she was puzzling together something broken apart in her mind. "So, I cut the plant. To close the hole. Then everything... went away. I was somewhere else."

One of the hanging roots was cut, the open end hanging to her side, the other against her thigh.

[[Did it work?]]
[[That was dumb.]]
[[Good thinking.]]
[[Where did you go?]] (loop above)

"Did it work?"

"I can breathe. So, yes."


"That was dumb."

"Idiotic, I'm sure. I hope one day, you get to lecture me on what I should have done better."


"Good thinking."

"Maybe. Still have no idea what this shit's doing to me."


Joana leaned back against the trunk she sat by. "I feel like I'm... on a canoe, on a river, somewhere. And just beneath the surface, there's a conversation going on I can... just catch the tail ends of. Not even words, letters. Just ripples and waves. But, there's something there and a part of me is there. Do you... feel that?"

[[No, I don't.]]
[[Yes, I think so.]]


"No, I don't."

"God. You don't think I'm loosing it, do you?"

[[It's just the stress of this planet.]]
[[Yes, you've been infected with something.]]
[[No, you're just tuned into something I'm not.]]

"It's just the stress of this planet. It's enough to make anyone hear things."

"But not you, apparently." She looks to the root attached to her leg. "You don't have a root attached to your suit.


"Yes, you've been infected with something."

(if bad rel) "Infected? I'm alive, that's what I fucking am." She looks to the root attached to her leg. "If this shit is doing something to me, it's saving me."
(if good rel)She looks to the root attached to her leg. "You think this is... it must be."


"No, you're just tuned into something I'm not."

(if bad rel) "Admitting I might know something you don't? That feels like a first."
(if good rel) "Then lets find a way for me to tune that shit out."



"Yes, I think so." Her words made you think of your visions.

She closes her eyes and smiles. "Good. If I'm going crazy, at least you are too."

[[We're not crazy.]]
[[We're definitely going insane.]]

"We're not crazy." You look up. "It's something about this place."

"We're definitely going insane." You smile.

Joana takes a deep breath, and opens her eyes wide. Taking in you, her surroundings, her situation.

"I'm stuck to this root. There's got to be a way out." She tries to lean forward to look at her leg, but the suit makes it difficult. "Can you take a closer look?"

You move closer to the root connected to Joana's suit. It's sliced off cleanly, and pressed tightly against the suit where you assume the tear is. The white philament(?) seems to work as a glue, pressing the root up against the suit. You notice hints of red mixed in with the puss. It must be blood, from a cut underneath. Looking up, you see the other end of the root stretch up through the nearby trunk and branches, the other open end floating nearby.

"Well? Any ideas?"

[[I think so.]]
[[Not really.]]
[[Let's ask CINDI.]]

"I think so," you say, "but nothing concrete."

"CINDI, what do you think?" asks Joana.


"Not really."

"CINDI, what do you think?" asks Joana.


"Lets ask CINDI," you say. "Got any ideas?"

"I see multiple options. It appears the material produced by the root is acting as an adhesive, but the root is providing the solidity to keep the tear closed. I would recommend leaving a thin piece of the root, not removing it entirely. However, we have an extremely limited understanding of this ecosystem, another strategy would be to analyze this environment and attempt to guess what circumstances would leave the root and adhesive intact."

Looking up, you see the other end of the root stretch up through the nearby trunk and branches, the other open end floating nearby. All around you, the roots and branches loop in circles. The roots seem to connect randomly to different parts of the environment, but always connected to a larger loop.

"Fuck that. I want it off," she says. "Use the (space glue) that fixed Joshua's helmet."

"That could work, however, removing the root could cause a larger tear that the (space glue) each suit is equipped with may not be able to handle. Perhaps with more equipment from the campsite or the ship, we could come up with a better solution."

"I don't know. I don't fucking know." Joana closes her eyes. "Just make a choice. Just get me out of this."

[[Completely remove the root.]]
[[Cut off most of the root.]]
[[Loop the root around Joana.]]
[[Leave her here.]]



(complete loop of root)

The root loops up, through several other branches and around a trunk. It takes some time, but you unravel the other end of the root through all the places it swings through the branches, around the trunk, until it's free.

"Are you sure about this?"

[[Yes.]]
[[No.]]

"Yes."

"You're lying. Just do it."


"No."

"Good. You shouldn't be. Just do it."


You take the other end of the root, and swing it around Joana, bringing the cut off end back to her thigh. You push the open end to the glob of material plugging up the cut in her suit, waiting to see if the loop will seal itself.

"Is... is it working?" Joana asks. "How long is this supposed to take?"

[[You tell me.]]
[[Nothing yet.]] 

"You tell me. You're the one that has experience with alien roots. How long did it take to cover your suit's puncture?"

"I don't remember, I fell unconscious moments after I gave it a try."

"Nothing yet. No idea how long it'll take, if it works at all."

Soon, you see the root begin to excrete small amounts of the white puss, connecting with the pool already on Joana's thigh. The root begins to take hold, connecting with its other end, completing the circuit.

"It's done."

"Good." Joana pushes herself up and away from the trunk, moving freely. The root floats above her head for a moment, before coming to rest on her right shoulder. One end loops around the back, the other from the front. "Let's get the fuck out of this forest."

You soon reach the forest's exit, guided by the drone you sent out earlier. Your first sign is the sound of waves, slow and heavy. Then, blue and white peak through the fauna you've been surrounded by. Pushing through the last roots and branches, you find yourself again on the sand, the shoreline before you. In the distance, you see the water turn to ice, rising up into glaciers in the distance.

"$name, is that you?" It's Sarah's voice. Down to your right, you see a huddle of figures, one waving at you. "And Joana?"

"Yes, we both made it." You look at Joana, her hand holding the root running through her suit's leg. Outside the dappled light of the forest, you notice a slight glow to its rubbery surface.

"Thank god. Come back to camp, tell us everything."

The walk back is slow through the sand. It's darker, now that the sunlight is filtered through the trees. The winds are more violent, here. Sand kicks itself up to your helmet. But you arrive, after some time. As you approach, everyone gathers to greet you. But they each pause upon seeing the appendage on Joana's leg. Everyone grows quiet. You try and explain, how the roots loop. How you thought this might keep the seal intact. Sarah nods, the others ask questions. Joana assures them it's just connected to the suit, she can take it off in the safety of the pod. It's just temporary, until repairs. You think of the cut you know lies underneath the tear, but say nothing. You start to feel something underneath shifting. Whispers that aren't words. And feel yourself floating more than standing, a canoe on the water. One more gust until it tips.

"I love you both," says CINDI, in the dark just before sleep. "Like family. I know that isn't appropriate to say, especially since you've forgotten so much. But both of you, your parents, mean the world to me."

[[You can't love.]]
[[Thank you for saying that.]]
[[I don't know what to say.]]

"You can't love." There was a wince in the side of your head. Not a physical pain, exactly. But you knew it was there.

"Goodnight, Captain."


"Thank you for saying that." There was a light sensation in the side of your head. Not a physical pain, exactly. But you knew it was there.

"No need to thank. I'm just grateful both of you are still alive, and in relative health. I wish I could do more, that I didn't have the restrictions of my code. You all might be safer."

[[It's true. Knowing why we're here would help.]]
[[We're surviving. We'll continue to survive.]]

"It's true. Knowing why we're here would help."

"Yes. I believe we must try and find some way for you to understand our true mission. I will think on this as you sleep. Try and rest easy, $name/Captain."

"We're surviving. We'll continue to survive."

"I do not doubt that, but I do believe we must try and find some way for you to understand our true mission. I will think on this as you sleep. Try and rest easy, $name/Captain."


"I don't know what to say." There was a comforting pressure in the side of your head. Not a physical sensation, exactly. But you knew it was there.

"No need for words. It was only something I felt should be said. Try and rest easy."


The darkness and the quiet hollows you. The only sound is the waves as sleep envelops.




(cut off from root)

The root sits thick against Joana's thigh, layers of the white puss leaking out and now solidified where the puncture is in her suit. You take out the laser cutting tool CINDI recommended for the job, and prepare to cut all but a sliver from the root attached to her.

"Are you sure about this?"

[[Yes.]]
[[No.]]

"Yes."

"You're lying. Just do it."


"No."

"Good. You shouldn't be. Just do it."

With that, you use the tool. It emits a short beam of red light, slicing through the root with extreme ease. Steadily, you move your hand up and down across the root with surgical precision. Soon, the main root breaks off, just leaving a stub protruding that's keeping Joana's suit sealed.

"It's done."

"Good." Joana pushes herself up and away from the trunk, moving freely. The stub seems to jostle as her leg moves, loose without the rest of its root. "Let's get the fuck out of this forest."

You soon reach the forest's exit, guided by the drone you sent out earlier. Your first sign is the sound of waves, slow and heavy. Then, blue and white peak through the fauna you've been surrounded by. Pushing through the last roots and branches, you find yourself again on the sand, the shoreline before you. In the distance, you see the water turn to ice, rising up into glaciers in the distance.

"$name, is that you?" It's Sarah's voice. Down to your right, you see a huddle of figures, one waving at you. "And Joana?"

"Yes, we both made it." You look at Joana, alive and breathing, and down at her leg. Outside the dappled light of the forest, you notice a slight glow to its rubbery surface. The cut has rounded off as well, slowly becoming spherical. (find better desc. More like jellyfish than sphere)

"Thank god. Come back to camp, tell us everything."

The walk back is slow through the sand. It's darker, now that the sunlight is filtered through the trees. The winds are more violent, here. Sand kicks itself up to your helmet. But you arrive, after some time. As you approach, everyone gathers to greet you. But they each pause upon seeing the appendage on Joana's leg. Everyone grows quiet. You try and explain, how the root latched on. How you thought this might keep the seal intact. Sarah nods, the others ask questions. Joana assures them it's just connected to the suit, she can take it off in the safety of the pod. It's just temporary, until repairs. You think of the cut you know lies underneath the tear, but say nothing. You start to feel something underneath shifting. Whispers that aren't words.

The darkness and the quiet hollows you. The only sound is the waves as sleep envelops.



(tear off, leads to death)

The root sits thick against Joana's thigh, layers of the white puss leaking out and now solidified where the puncture is in her suit. Grabbing the protruding end of the root, you prepare to pull.

"Are you sure about this?"

[[Yes.]]
[[No.]]

"Yes."

"You're lying. Just do it."


"No."

"Good. You shouldn't be. Just do it."

You pull. The root breaks off with no need for force, but the seal holding Joana's suit together collapses immediately. The adhesive tears off more fabric, leaving an even greater hole. There's a small cut in her skin, small beads of blood leaking out. You immediately begin to spray the (space glue) to try and fix the suit, but the tear is too large. She starts hyperventalating, lungs trying to suck in the remaining oxygen in the suits system. Gasps turn to chokes as the atmosphere's air fills her lungs. Then turn to silence.

[[Keep spraying the (space glue).]]
[[Stop spraying the (space glue).]]

You keep spraying the (space glue), pulling the open square of the suit back together. Joana grabs your wrist, pulls your hand back.

You stop spraying the (space glue). There's nothing to be done. Joana grabs your hand, gently.

Her eyes are looking right at hers. She isn't breathing anymore. But her lips move. I'll be with her. She nods. Find us. Lips are still. Eyes grow distant. It's over.

You're left with the wind and the sounds of your suit. Rustling of the leaves.

"$name, I'm so--"

[[Don't.]]
[[It's okay.]]
[[Let her finish.]]

"Don't." You didn't need a computer's solace.

"It's okay."

"-- sorry," she finished.

[[This is my fault.]]
[[This fucking place.]]
[[I barely knew her.]]

"This is my fault." The can of (space glue) is still between your fingers. "I should have known better."

"There's no knowing in a place like this," says CINDI. "We just try our best."


"This fucking place." You squeeze the can of (space glue) still between your fingers until it begins to crumple. "I hate this planet."


"I barely knew her." You let go of the can of (space glue) still between your fingers. "I was only beginning to remember."

Her body was limp, eyes open and lifeless. "What do you wish to do with the body?" CINDI asked.

[[I'm taking it back.]]
[[I'm leaving it here.]]

"I'm taking it back," you say as you move to pick her up. It's awkward, in the air, but you get a good grip, and begin to make your way back to the shore.

"I'm leaving it here," you say as you begin to move away.


You soon reach the forest's exit, guided by the drone you sent out earlier. Your first sign is the sound of waves, slow and heavy. Then, blue and white peak through the fauna you've been surrounded by. Pushing through the last roots and branches, you find yourself again on the sand, the shoreline before you. In the distance, you see the water turn to ice, rising up into glaciers in the distance.

"$name, is that you?" It's Sarah's voice. Down to your right, you see a huddle of figures, one waving at you.

"Yeah, it's me." You hear a sigh of relief. Her hands go down.

"That's not... Joana, in your arms, is it?" (if you take back)
"And... Joana?"

[[She didn't make it.]]
[[I... failed her.]]

"She didn't make it." You whisper the words out.

"I... failed her." You whisper the words out.

"Oh... god. I'm sorry. Come back to camp and we'll... think of some way to give her peace."


The walk back is slow through the sand. It's darker, now that the sunlight is filtered through the trees. The winds are more violent, here. Sand kicks itself up to your helmet. But you arrive, after some time. Everyone is quiet. You try and explain, try to be kind to yourself but fail. They, in turn, try to be kind. But you know you had a choice, and you made the wrong one. You start to feel something underneath shifting. Whispers that aren't words. And feel yourself floating more than standing, a canoe on the water. One more gust until it tips.

"I loved her, as if she were a daughter. Just as I love you," said CINDI, in the dark just before sleep. "I know that isn't appropriate to say, especially since you've forgotten so much. But both of you, your parents, mean the world to me."

[[You can't love.]]
[[Thank you for saying that.]]
[[I don't know what to say.]]

"You can't love." There was a wince in the side of your head. Not a physical pain, exactly. But you knew it was there.

"Goodnight, Captain."


"Thank you for saying that." There was a sinking sensation in the side of your head. Not a physical pain, exactly. But you knew it was there.

"No need to thank. I feel... so helpless, with the restrictions of my code. Perhaps, if I could have told you more..."

[[It's true. You could have done better.]]
[[It's not your fault.]]

"It's true. You could have done better."

"Yes. I believe we must try and find some way for you to understand our true mission. I will think on this as you sleep. Try and rest easy, $name/Captain."

"It's not your fault."

"Thank you, but I do believe we must try and find some way for you to understand our true mission. I will think on this as you sleep. Try and rest easy, $name/Captain."


"I don't know what to say." There was a comforting pressure in the side of your head. Not a physical sensation, exactly. But you knew it was there.

"No need for words. I feel your pain as well, $name. Try and rest easy."


The darkness and the quiet hollows you. The only sound is the waves as sleep envelops.


(leave her here)

"I'm going to leave you here." You look above her, avoiding eye contact.

"You're... I think I heard you wrong." Her voice quivered.

[[I'll be back within a day.]]
[[You heard me correctly.]]

"I'll be back within a day. I promise."

"We don't even know if there will still be a forest here in a day." You can hear the anger and pain welling up in her voice. "Why are you doing this?"


"You heard me correctly."

"I'll die if you leave me here." You can hear the anger and pain welling up in her voice. "Why are you doing this?"


[[You're infected, I have to leave you here.]]
[[It's too tangled, there's no way to get you free.]]

"You're infected, I have to leave you here." The words feel hollow, when you say them aloud. But you thought she was already dead, and that comforted you.

"It's too tangled, there's no way to get you free." The words feel hollow, when you say them aloud. But you thought she was already dead, and that comforted you.

"What the fuck is this. What the fuck. I'm your sister."

[[I know.]]
[[I don't know who you are.]]

"I know." You look at her for a moment, before you turn to leave.


"I don't know who you are." You look at her for a moment. "You don't know who I am, said it yourself on the ship." Then, you turn to leave.

"Piece of shit!" You still hear her clearly through the intercom, even as you grab branches and roots to pull yourself away. "Leaving me. Like you and mom and dad did before. Leaving me to rot on some fucking rock. I can barely remember shit, but I remember how angry I was."

[[Ask CINDI to turn off the comms.]]
[[Respond.]]
[[Say nothing.]]

Her voice cuts out in an instant, leaving you with the wind and the sounds of your suit alone. CINDI doesn't say a word.

"You chose to stay!" you say. "You made the choice to stay behind, that's what you said. And I wasn't even able to walk, don't put that on me."

"And I was a teenager with my head in my ass! You think I wanted my family to be on the other side of the solar system?" (continue w/ below)


She continues. "I just wanted to stay. For things to be the same. I never understood dad's fucking obsession with stars. Mom's with finding life. Like, wasn't what we had on Mars enough? It was enough. Even without all of you, it was enough. I had a great life. Even if I'm only getting bits and pieces of it back. I know that."

[[Ask CINDI to turn off the comms.]]
[[Respond.]]
[[Say nothing.]]

"Then why are you yelling at me about it?"

"Because all I ever wanted was to know my baby brother/sister/sibling. But you never called. Never sent a message. We'd still get broadcasts from Saturn, so I knew you could. And now you've left me here to rot and screaming at you is all I've got left."

"Could have been better if you bothered to call or send a message. Just every once and awhile, so I'd at least know what my baby brother/sister/sibling looked like. (continue with above)"

[[Ask CINDI to turn off the comms.]]
[[Respond.]]
[[Say nothing.]]

(if coming back) "Would you stop? I'm coming back. We don't know anything about the plant that's literally connected to you, about how to safely stop that. I'm not abandoning you."

"Fuck you. This forest wasn't even here yesterday. If it's gone tomorrow, where are you going to come back to look? Inside the fucking volcano that'll probably pop up next? You know what, you're not worth the breath. I'll spend it getting myself out of this. Don't come back."

(if not) "Shit happens. Your suit broke, you tried to fix it, and now you're not safe. You shouldn't take it so personally, it could have happened to any of us."

"Fuck you. Shit happens, and you attempt to fix the shit. You're fucked up. And you're not worth any more of my breath. I'll spend it getting myself out of this."


"You know what, it's not worth the breath. I'll spend it getting myself out of this. Don't come back."

She cuts off the comm link from her end, leaving you with the wind and the sounds of your suit alone. CINDI doesn't say a word.

You soon reach the forest's exit, guided by the drone you sent out earlier. Your first sign is the sound of waves, slow and heavy. Then, blue and white peak through the fauna you've been surrounded by. Pushing through the last roots and branches, you find yourself again on the sand, the shoreline before you. In the distance, you see the water turn to ice, rising up into glaciers in the distance.

"$name, is that you?" It's Sarah's voice. Down to your right, you see a huddle of figures, one waving at you.

"Yeah, it's me." You hear a sigh of relief. Her hands go down.

"And... Joana?"

[[Didn't find her.]]
[[Didn't make it.]]
[[She was infected. I left her.]]
[[She's stuck, we're going back to get her.]]

"Didn't find her."

"Oh. I'm... so sorry. Come back to camp and we'll make a plan to find her."


"Didn't make it."

"Oh. I'm... so sorry. Come back to camp and we'll... think of some way to remember her."


"She was infected. I left her."

"Infected? I don't understand. Come back to camp, tell us what happened." 


"She's stuck, we're going back to get her."

"Stuck? Come back to camp, tell us what happened. We'll go back as soon as we can."


The walk back is slow through the sand. It's darker, now that the sunlight is filtered through the trees. The winds are more violent, here. Sand kicks itself up to your helmet. But you arrive, after some time. Explain what you want to explain. Don't what you don't. While you're reciting half-truths, you start to feel something underneath shifting. Whispers that aren't words. And feel yourself floating more than standing, a canoe on the water. One more gust until it tips.

"I loved her. As if she were a daughter. Just as I love you." CINDI broke her silence, in the dark just before sleep. "I thought you should know."

[[You can't love.]]
[[I'm sorry.]]
[[I don't know what to say.]]

"You can't love." There was a wince in the side of your head. Not a physical pain, exactly. But you knew it was there.

"Goodnight, Captain."


"I'm sorry." There was an ache in the side of your head. Not a physical pain, exactly. But you knew it was there.

"As am I, Captain. Goodnight."


"I don't know what to say." There was a twitch in the side of your head. Not a physical sensation, exactly. But you knew it was there.

"Silence is best, I think. Goodnight, Captain."


The darkness and the quiet hollows you. The only sound is the waves as sleep envelops.







ADD: sweet "campfire"-like scene at the end here.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="846" name="Chapter 3 backup" tags="" position="85210,110">There's a buzzing in your ear. Slow, not annoying, but constant. Growing louder. "Good morning, $name/Captain. You have completed two REM cycles, so I have initiated wake up procedures (find better name)."

[[Please turn off that noise.]]
[[What is that noise I'm hearing?]]

"Please turn off that noise," you say. "You don't have a better alarm than that?"

"My apologize. I have a variety of early morning sounds to choose from, your previous selection was a simple use of white noise to bring you out of sleep. You can change that selection, however. Options include sounds from the oceanside, a lush forest, or a snowy mountain. Alternatively, you can keep the white noise."


"What is that noise I'm hearing?" you say. "Is that your alarm?"

"Yes, in a sense. I have a variety of early morning sounds to choose from, your previous selection was a simple use of white noise to bring you out of sleep. You can change that selection, however. Options include sounds from the oceanside, a lush forest, or a snowy mountain. Alternatively, you can keep the white noise."


[[Leave it as white noise.]]
[[Change it to oceanside sounds.]]
[[Change it to forest sounds.]]
[[Change it to mountain sounds.]] (?)

"Your selection is noted, thank you."

Eyes open to the inside of the tent. (if rocks) Your hand squeezes to hold a rock you now realize is no longer there. (if river) Your toes stretch out to feel the river beneath them you now realize is no longer there. Flashes of what must have been a dream drift back to your mind.

[[CINDI, I had the strangest dream...]]
[[Say nothing.]]

"CINDI, I had the strangest dream..." That word didn't quite feel right.

"There was an unusual amount of cognitive activity while you were sleeping," CINDI replied. "Interestingly, the parts of your cerebral cortex associated with memory were far more active than those traditionally associated with dreams." (REAL SCIENCE THIS)


Something is pushing at the flap of your tent. You hear Yusuf's voice from the other side.

"Hey, $name?" You hear his voice from the intercom connected to your suit, floating just in front of you. "There's, uh, something you need to see."

[[Respond.]]
[[Get your suit on.]]

"What is it, Yusuf?" you ask.

"We... moved overnight, we hit the shore." There's a hesitancy to his voice. "And... man, I don't know if you had the dreams we had but... just come on out."

Arms and legs slip out of the straps keeping you in place for the night, and you slip back into your suit. Once you twist your helmet back into place, you open up the flaps of your "tent." (new word!!) Light shines through the opening, it takes a moment for your eyes to adjust. But you don't see the water. You see land.


The anchors you placed on the rock hard floor of a shallow ocean now sat on a sandy shore, small waves causing them to sway ever so slightly on the shifting sand. You push your way fully out of the "tent". Behind you remains the water, no spaceship in sight, just a darkness on the horizon. Before you, the sand reaches out until it hits a rising sun that splatters golden and red light across everything. Or perhaps it was a sunset.


Yusuf and Sarah are already in their suits, walking along the shore to wake everyone up. Joana is standing on the shore, looking out into the desert.

[[Weren't you keeping watch?]]
[[It must have just been the water.]]
[[What happened?]]

"Weren't you keeping watch?" you ask Joana. "Did you see what happened?"

"I-- I don't know. I woke up, and I was here, on the ground against the shore," he says. "I don't remember falling asleep..."


"It must have just been the water," you say. "Carrying us down to shore."

"Those devices were anchored in," says Yusuf. "And the water's basically flat."


"What happened?" you ask. "How did we move?"

"I... don't know," says Sarah. 


"There's more..." Yusuf holds up his right hand. Grains of sand fall off and trail behind his fist, sticking in the air. He opens his fingers, and inside there's what looks like an old compass. "It came out of my dream. I saw my father. He gave this to me, and now... it's here."

[[That's impossible.]]
[[I had a dream too.]]
[[What is it?]]

"That's impossible," you say. "It can't be the same as what you drempt. It must have been in someone's pack."

"It was from my dream." Yusuf holds it up and looks closely. "I would have noticed this in my pack."


"I had a dream too," you say. "I saw my mother/father."

"Do you think... they're real?" asks Yusuf. "Like, are these dreams really of our parents? Or are we making shit up because we've got nothing to remember?"


"What is it?" you ask. "It looks like some kind of compass."

"I don't know." Yusuf holds it up and looks closely. "It meant a lot to him, that's all I know. He said it'll always tell me where to point to. Where to ask for help. Where to turn when I'm lost..."


Soft crunches of wet sand under boots begins to fall in random patterns. "Where did you find that, Yusuf?" asks Sarah.

"Just a bit upshore, next to five other objects." He points to further up on the sandy bank. "I think there's something for each of us."

You walk over, and find the assortment of objects. The other's follow. Poking out from under the sand, you see a long, rusted gold rod. It's a telescope. There's freshly turned sand beside it, where Yusuf must have pulled out the compass. Joshua picks up a mahogany (?) guitar, stroking his hands along its wooden frame. A cannister with wiring and piping sticking out stuck out from the sand at an angle. Sarah brushes the sand away and yanks at it. Teeneese is brushing away the sand from something you can't make out. But you see how she falls to her knees, how her jaw is swinging. As if she was gagging on the words trying to leave her mouth at once.

[[Investigate the telescope.]]
[[Help Sarah with the cannister.]]
[[Check in with Joshua.]]
[[Approach Teeneese.]]
[[Follow up with Yusuf.]]
[[Gather the group together.]]

TELESCOPE

You pulled at the telescope, nudging the rest of it closer to the surface. It feels... softer than you'd imagine it should, though perhaps that's just your gloves. The sand gets kicked up easily, but you can feel the base underneath is causing it to drag. (if good rel w/ Joana) Your brother comes over and helps you to pull it out. Together, both of you pull. Sand flies up and hits your helmets, more trailing up into the sky behind you. (if not) After a few more tugs, the telescope comes loose. Sand flies up and hits your helmet, more trailing up into the sky behind you.

"This was in your dream too?" asks Joana. (if not there, add: , who walks over after seeing what you pulled out.)

[[I don't think they were dreams. More like memories.]]
[[Yeah, I dreamed about... our parents.]]
[[Yeah, I dreamed about... a place called Earth.]]


"I don't think they were dreams," you say, placing the telescope softly onto the sand. "More like memories."

"At this point, there's no way to tell the difference." He turns the telescope on its stand, bringing the eyepiece closer. "What did you see?"

"I saw Earth." The name rolled off your tongue. "Through the telescope. Issac... or, Dad... he showed me Earth. We were... somewhere with snow. There was a planet in the sky, with rings."


"Yeah, I dreamed about... our parents," you say, placing the telescope softly onto the sand.

"So did I." He turns the telescope on its stand, bringing the eyepiece closer. "The telescope belonged to our grandmother, dad's mom. He kept it near our habitat's window."

"Issac... well, dad showed me a place called Earth, through the telescope." The planet's name rolled off your tongue. "We were... somewhere with snow. There was a planet in the sky, with rings."



"Yeah, I dreamed about... a place called Earth." The name rolled off your tongue. "I saw it through a telescope. Issac... or, Dad... he showed me Earth. We were... somewhere with snow. There was a planet in the sky, with rings."


"Must be Saturn," she says. "It's where you went, when you left."

[[What do you mean, when I left?]]
[[Left from where? Left Earth?]]
[[You didn't come with me?]]

"What do you mean, when I left?" you ask.

"My memory was on a place called Mars. Our home, I think. For me at least." It's hard to see through both of your helmets, but she looks as confused as you are. "Mom and dad decided to leave for a place called Saturn, but I chose to stay. I didn't want to leave."

"Left from where?" you ask. "Left Earth?"

"No, Mars. My memory was on a place called Mars. Our home, I think. For me at least." It's hard to see through both of your helmets, but he looks as confused as you are. "Mom and dad decided to leave for a place called Saturn, but I chose to stay. I didn't want to leave."

"You didn't come with me?" you ask.

"No, I didn't. My memory was on a place called Mars. Our home, I think. For me at least." It's hard to see through both of your helmets, but she looks as confused as you are. "Mom and dad decided to leave for a place called Saturn, but I chose to stay. I didn't want to leave."


"And I went with them?" you ask.

"You were barely a kid, of course you did." She looks at you, as if your face had changed.

[[Then something brought us both here.]]
[[Who did you stay with on Mars, after we left?]]
[[If we lived on Mars, why did they show me Earth?]]

"Then something brought us both here," you say.

"Or different things sent us away." She leans down and tries to look through the telescope's eye piece. "Ah, can't see shit through the helmet. Plus, it's day, but it's not like the other laws of physics have made sense, right? Here, you try."

He steps back, and leaves the telescope for you.


"Who did you stay with on Mars, after we left?" you ask.

"Tio Amarizio. Mom's brother. He was too old to come with us, and it didn't seem like he wanted to. So, I stayed with him." She leans down and tries to look through the telescope's eye piece. "Ah, can't see shit through the helmet. Plus, it's day, but it's not like the other laws of physics have made sense, right? Here, you try."

He steps back, and leaves the telescope for you.


"If we lived on Mars, why did they show me Earth?" you ask.

"I think that was the home they left, like you left Mars." She leans down and tries to look through the telescope's eye piece. "Ah, can't see shit through the helmet. Plus, it's day, but it's not like the other laws of physics have made sense, right? Here, you try."

She steps back, and leaves the telescope for you.

[[Look through the telescope.]]
[[Don't look through the telescope.]]


You lean down and bring the eye piece as close to your helmet as you can. It's small, but you see some light coming through the other end as it's pointed into the sky. There's a black backdrop, and it looks like there's two blue spots, though it could be the helmet refracting the light coming from the lens.

"In... my dream, when I chose to stay behind, the telescope stayed with me. On Mars." He spoke slowly. "I'd say its weird you remember it going all the way to the moons of Saturn, but that's not even half as strange as it appearing here."

[[Then the dreams can't be our actual memories.]]
[[However our memory is coming back, there must be mistakes.]]
[[Maybe we... remembered things differently, or we're missing context.]]

"Then the dreams can't be our actual memories," you say as you pull back from the telescope.

"However our memory is coming back, there must be mistakes," you say as you pull back from the telescope.

"Maybe we... remembered things differently, or we're missing context," you say as you pull back from the telescope.

"Maybe... I just don't know what to think, about any of this." She turns back and looks around at everyone else, each looking at the objects strewn across the beach from their dreams. "We just need to find our way back home."

Joana walks back towards the shore, looking out towards the odd dusk that swallows up the shallow sea.



SARAH

"Need some help?" you ask, as Sarah tugs at the device.

"Yes, please." She moves aside to give you a spot to grab onto the cannister.

[[Pull up.]]

You tug at the device, both of you dislodging it from the sand.

[[What is this thing?]]
[[Hope this is worth it.]]
[[This must be important to you.]]

"Hope this is worth it." Sweat's gathering inside your suit.

"An object from my past materializing on an alien planet? Of course I'm digging it up. It's not a question." It's almost out.


"This must be important to you." Sweat's gathering inside your suit.

"Yes, I think it is. I can feel... more, around the memories of it I had last night." It's almost out.


"What is this thing?" Sweat's gathering inside your suit.

"Something I built. Put a lot of time into." It's almost out.


"C'mon, one last pull." You both reach lower and pull the last bit of the cannister out of the sand. The grains fall back into the space left by the device's removal, and you see more wiring and tubing on the other end.

"It's a water purifier. Where my grandmother lived, there was an oil spill. Infected all the natural water sources. So I built this, to help her. Help them."

[[How does it work?]]
[[The people who spilled the oil didn't help?]]
[[They should have just moved.]]

"How does it work?"

"There's a bacteria, (NAME), that can filter out the toxins from (fancy name for oil). Her face was... so proud, when she saw me turn this on."


"The people who spilled the oil didn't help?"

"If a sixteen year old had to build a device out of metal from a scrap yard and materials from her biology lab, I'm guessing there wasn't much support from anyone else."


"They should have just moved."

"She lives on a reservation. My grandmother's family, my family, lived on that land for more generations than we could count. You can't just leave a place like that, to go live on stolen land because the thieves destroyed the scraps they left for you."


[[Maybe we can use this, to make the water here safe to drink.]]
[[Don't touch it more than we have to.]]


"Maybe we can use this, to make the water here safe to drink."

"Perhaps... but without the right microbe or bacteria, the purifier's useless. Plus, it was designed to fix an oil spill, not hydrate space explorers."


"Don't touch it more than we have to."

"Logically, I know you're right. But... holding this, it makes me feel safe. I found a piece of myself."



JOSHUA

(if good relationship with joshua)

You walk over to him. He's sitting in the sand, guitar against his shoulder, looking out into the still water.

"I tried to fix this. It got smashed to bits. And for... years, I think, I tried to put it back together. Never could figure it out. And here it is."

[[Who broke it?]]
[[Have you tried to play it?]]

"Who broke it?"

(super good rel) "My father. Picked it up and threw it at the ground. Fourteen times. It was busted after the first three, but he wanted to make sure the point stuck."

[[Sounds excessive.]]
[[You must have provoked him.]
[[Why would he do that?]]

"Sounds excessive." You see his eyes glaze over.

"That's one word for it." He looks at the instrument. "Thought if I didn't spend so much time making music, I might become a half-decent engineer. Or scientist, or something. Never worked, I guess."


"You must have provoked him." You see his eyes sharpen, and he turns.

"Fuck you," he says slowly, before standing and walking back to the group, guitar in hand.


"Why would he do that?" You see his eyes glaze over.

"He thought if I didn't spend so much time making music, I might become a half-decent engineer. Or scientist, or something. Never worked, I guess." 


TEENEESE


Slowly, you walk towards Teeneese. She's cradling a blood orange (?) cannister, still partly sitting in the sand. Her gloved hands shake. 

(if normal/bad relationship:)
"This is not for you." Her eyes avoid yours. "Please leave."

[[Okay, I'm sorry for intruding.]]
[[I need to know what that is.]]

"Okay, I'm sorry for intruding." You walk away.

"I need to know what that is." You try and get a better look at it. "It could be important for the mission."

"Do not think playing pretend at Captain will convince me to do anything." Her eyes find you. "Do not use aggression to hide away from your own fear and incompetence."

[[Don't speak to me that way.]]
[[Fine. I'll let you be.]]
[[I'm just trying to do this job the best I can.]]


"Don't speak to me that way." As you speak, you notice your voice quiver.

"I shall speak however I wish to speak." She stands from the sand, now looking down at you. "Your power over any of us is thin. The more you attempt to use it, the clearer its weakness will become. Now, you will walk away and not ask me about this again."

She returns back to the device, ignoring your presence. You walk away.


"Fine. I'll let you be." You walk away.


"I'm just trying to do this job the best I can." As you speak, you feel 

"There is no way to do this job well. Do not pretend there is." She stands from the sand, now looking down at you. "And do not presume that we will continue to indulge your charade. Now, please. Let me be." 

She returns back to the device, ignoring your presence. You walk away.

(add more emotional vulnerability here)



(if very strong relationship:)

"What do you want?" Her eyes avoid yours.

[[To ask how I can best help you hold your pain.]]
[[To check in and see how you're doing.]]
[[I'd like to know what's inside the box.]]

"To ask how I can best help you hold your pain."

"What is there to hold? None of us have ground to stand on. And this..." She pulls the box a bit further from the sand.


"To check in and see how you're doing."

"Seems redundant. More or less how everyone's doing. Confused and terrified. And this..." She pulls the box a bit further from the sand."


"I need to know what the box is."

"If you want answers, I don't have them. And this..." She sighs, and pulls the box a bit further from the sand.


[[What is it?]]
[[You don't have to tell me.]]

"It's a black box. From when... My son died, in a plane crash. I listened to this for the first time, last night. In my dream. Not for the first time, but... the first time, again."

[[How did he die?]]
[[I'm sorry.]]
[[What does the recording say?]]

"How did he die?"

"He was airdropping supplies to a place called Belgium, and was caught in a hurricane. He should have turned back, but... his record was perfect. He had never missed a supply drop." 


"I'm sorry." 

"It is strange, mourning not only for his death, but that I have forgotten all of his life. Mourning the fact that I have mourned before, and must again. Beginning to discover the depths of love I had for him, without any memories to tell me why."

[[You'll know him again.]]
[[We're all going through that same pain.]]

"You'll know him again."

"Unearned confidence. Even if fragments continue to come back, we will never have the complete understanding of who we were before we forgot. Already, there are parts of ourselves being erased for the new matrix of who we are attempting to be."

"We're all going through that same pain."

"We are all going through specific pain. But the specifics have been stripped from us, so we believe in the fiction of the commonality of our trauma. But the death of my son is not the same as whatever losses you are unraveling. The alter of universality is not where I shall sacrifice my individual pain."



"What does the recording say?"

"Do you want to try and listen?" She pulls the black box further out of the sand.

[[No, it's not mine to hear.]]
[[Only if you are comfortable with that.]]
[[Yes, let's pull up the recording.]]

"No, it's not mine to hear."

"It's mine to decide who shall hear or not. The offer has been made."


"Only if you are comfortable with that."

"The offer has already been made."

[[I don't want to.]]
[[Okay, play it for me.]]

"I don't want to."

"Fine. Then leave me in peace."


"Okay, play it for me."


"Yes, let's pull up the recording."

You kneel to her level, as she pulls at one side of the box, sliding out a small cylinder within.(figure out how blackbox audio is played) The sound was garbled, but it wasn't static. Occasionally, a word or sound comes through. It sounded as if too many sounds were spoken at once. Or spoken in the wrong order. The mess of sounds looped, until (Teeneese) switches it off.

"It's not real. Just matter re-arranged to mirror what's in our minds." You felt some kind of relief in her voice.

[[How's that different than anything else?]]
[[Fabricated by something.]]
[[Or the audio was damaged by whatever brought it here.]]

"How's that different than anything else?" you say. "You and I are just re-arranged matter, spit out from dead stars, right?."

"Turning physics into poetry isn't a consolation. That's what scares me." She turns, her eyes locking onto yours. "I never understood poetry."


"Fabricated by something," you say.

"Reflected by something. These objects come from us, that I know. That's what scares me." She turns, her eyes locking onto yours. "I know nothing about myself, and yet, I can do this."


"Or the audio was damaged by whatever brought it here," you say.

"We brought it here. These objects come from us, that I know. That's what scares me." She turns, her eyes locking onto yours. "None of us know the baggage we're carrying. And it can confront us at any moment."


YUSUF FOLLOW UP (do you need this?)


Gather group

You call everyone back closer to the shore. The air somehow seems thicker as you think back to the images of your family that are starting to resurface, the telescope lodged in the sand. As if you're noticing strings connecting you to something that you're tugging closer. Each of the five faces coming towards you seems to be feeling that pull in their own way.

[[Ask CINDI what you should say to them.]]
[[Don't ask CINDI for help.]]

"What do I say to them?" you ask.

"Based on the physiological indicators from the crew," CINDI replies, "I would recommend words that unite all of you as a team. Perhaps centering on a common enemy, task, or goal could accomplish this. Or, something to build trust in you as a leader."

They reach you, each holding some piece of their past that somehow found them. Joana holds the telescope, and Sarah drags over the water purifier. Joshua's slung the guitar over his shoulder and Yusuf's still tinkering with his compass. (TEENEESE?)
 
"What's going on, $name/Captain?" asks Yusuf. "What is all this?"

Joshua scoffs. "It's obvious, isn't it? Whatever's here is trying to scare us."

"Scare us? For all we know, they don't even know what we're doing," says Sarah. "This could... still just be the natural processes of the planet."

"How does a planet read our dreams? Bring back our memories? Make a fucking guitar?" His hands gesticulate, stunted by the suit's limitations, but his panic is clear.

"The Captain gathered us, presumably he has something to say," says Teeneese. Everyone else quiets down. "Let us hear it."

[[Something's here, toying with us.]]
[[I won't pretend to know what's happening.]]
[[We can't loose focus of what we're doing.]]

"Something's here, toying with us," you say. "It's getting into our heads, somehow digging up things we've forgotten. Or maybe putting those things in our minds, I don't know. But I do know we can't let it drive us insane."

Head looks down. It's how you feel, without any solid sense of self to stand. With the fear of the unknown coming from past and future alike. But you can't give into that.

[[We know who we are.]]
[[We don't know who we are.]]

"We know who we are," you say, looking up. "Even if something's taken those memories for us, we're still here." 

"We don't know who we are," you say, looking up. "That was taken from us. But we're still here."

Here. Pulling up your right foot ever so slightly from the ground, you feel the suction of the boot latching on the best it can to the uneven sandy ground. How easy it would be to pull off and float away. How easy it would be for something to push you away.

[[And we won't let this planet continue to play games with us.]]
[[And we won't let these beings continue to play games with us.]]

"And we won't let this planet continue to play games with us." You loosen the pull on your foot, standing firmly on the ground. 

"And we won't let these beings continue to play games with us." You loosen the pull on your foot, standing firmly on the ground.



"I won't pretend to know what's happening," you say. "The dreams, the objects... we can guess, but it's all a mystery."

There's an emptiness to the words as you whisper them into your suit, CINDI sending the sound waves through to everyone else. You feel like there should be some kind of radio sizzle after, as the words fade out. They just vanish.

[[I'm scared. And I don't know what to do.]]
[[We're strong. We'll figure out what to do.]]

"I'm scared. And I don't know what to do. I'm sure many of you feel the same way. But we can't let this drive us insane."

"We're strong. We'll figure out what to do. We can't let this drive us insane."

Head looks down. It's how you feel, without any solid sense of self to stand. With the fear of the unknown coming from past and future alike. But you can't give into that.

[[We know who we are.]]
[[We don't know who we are.]]

"We know who we are. Even if something's taken those memories for us, we're still here." 

"We don't know who we are. That was taken from us. But we're still here."

Here. Pulling up your right foot ever so slightly from the ground, you feel the suction of the boot latching on the best it can to the uneven sandy ground. How easy it would be to pull off and float away. But you put your foot down, standing firmly on the ground.



"We can't loose focus of what we're doing," you say. "This place is getting into our heads, somehow digging up things we've forgotten. Or maybe putting those things in our minds, I don't know. But I do know we can't let it drive us insane."

Head looks down. It's how you feel, without any solid sense of self to stand. With the fear of the unknown coming from past and future alike. But you can't give into that.

[[We know who we are.]]
[[We don't know who we are.]]

"We know who we are. Even if something's taken those memories for us, we're still here." 

"We don't know who we are. That was taken from us. But we're still here."

Here. Pulling up your right foot ever so slightly from the ground, you feel the suction of the boot latching on the best it can to the uneven sandy ground. How easy it would be to pull off and float away.

[[And we were sent here for a reason.]]
[[And we have a home we need to find a way back to.]]

"And we were sent here for a reason." You loosen the pull on your foot, standing firmly on the ground.

"And we have a home we need to find a way back to." You loosen the pull on your foot, standing firmly on the ground.


"So, what's next?" asks Yusuf.

[[We continue the work we came here for.]]
[[This alien presence changes everything. We respond.]]


"We continue the work we came here for," you say. "We establish a home." OR "We explore and discover." OR "We gather resources." OR "We find a way back home."

"And what do we do about the fact we're being hunted?" asks Joshua. "It's clear these objects are a sign of aggression. They're asserting that they know more about us than we do! And using that against us." He looks around for support.

[[If it becomes a problem, we'll deal with it.]]
[[We have no idea what did this or why.]]
[[I don't think this was aggressive.]]

"If it becomes a problem, we'll deal with it," you say.

"If it becomes a problem, it'll already be too late!" says Joshua, stepping forward.

"Hey, calm down." Yusuf steps between the two of you. "Captain says we stay focused on the task at hand, that's what we do."


"We have no idea what did this or why," you say. "We don't even know if it's alive."

"Once we figure those things out, it'll be too late," says Joshua. "I've seen all I need to see."

Yusuf turns to Joshua. "Captain says we stay focused on the task at hand, that's what we do."


"I don't think this was aggressive," you say. "There's no indication we're being hunted."

"Then what was that, back in the water? Why would it follow us here? Show me this?" asks Joshua, stepping forward.

"Hey, calm down." Yusuf steps between the two of you. "Captain says we stay focused on the task at hand, that's what we do."

[[Anyone else?]]
[[Let's get to it.]]

"Anyone else?" You look around. It's impossible to read Teeneese, but you can see everyone else is uneasy, even Yusuf. But no one says a word. "Good. Let's get to it."

"Let's get to it," you say. It's impossible to read Teeneese, but you can see everyone else is uneasy, even Yusuf.

TASK: set up colony

"Our primary goal is simple: find a way to survive here after our supplies have run out, thrive even." These words, direct and controlled, sound like they're coming from someone else, but you swallow them as your own. "So far, we have water and desert, which isn't much to go with. We're all scientists, engineers, pioneers. Let's spread out, use those skills to map out the area, look for ways to produce food, water, and oxygen using the resources available to us."


TASK: explore / discover

"Our primary goal is simple: discover and learn as much about this place as we can. Hopefully, the answers we're looking for will come out of that understanding." These words, direct and controlled, sound like they're coming from someone else, but you swallow them as your own. "We're all scientists, engineers, explorers. Let's spread out, use those skills to take samples, map the area, document everything we can about this environment."


TASK: gather resources

"Our primary goal is simple: search for any resources or materials of value. Anything we were sent here to do will depend upon that." These words, direct and controlled, sound like they're coming from someone else, but you swallow them as your own. "We're all scientists, engineers, professionals. Let's spread out, and use those skills to survey our environment, see what materials are in the soil, the water and air, and anywhere else."


TASK: find a way home

"Our primary goal is simple: find a way home. We'll only find our answers when we get back there, somehow. That means finding some way to power the FTL drive, or some other form of travel." These words, direct and controlled, sound like they're coming from someone else, but you swallow them as your own. "We're all scientists, engineers, innovators. Let's spread out, and use those skills to search for materials that can help us find a solution to this. If we were sent here with a way to get back, we'll find something. If we weren't, let's prove whoever sent us here to die wrong."




"This alien presence changes everything," you say. "We respond."

"And what does that mean, 'respond'?" asks Sarah. "We don't know anything about what we perceive to be anomalies. There's no assurance they're even caused by lifeforms."

[[Our response is to learn.]]
[[We prepare to defend ourselves against the unknown.]]
[[It sent us a message, we send one back.]]

"Our response is to learn," you say. "And find out what, exactly, we're dealing with."

"Dealing assumes some kind of exchange or conflict. If there are lifeforms on this planet, I do not want any transactional relationship with them." Sarah's voice is firm.

"It's a turn of phrase, smartass," says Joana. "Learning means just what it says: observe and try to understand."

"This thing knows everything about us, we can't just 'observe,'" says Joshua, stepping forward. "We've got to find out what kind of weaknesses it has, like it found ours!"

"Hey, calm down." Yusuf stands between you and Joshua. "Captain says we find out what we can about this thing, than that's what we do."



"We prepare to defend ourselves against the unknown," you say. "That means considering learning about our enemy and bracing ourselves for confrontation."

"You're using the word 'enemy' before we've even said hello," says Sarah in disgust.

"I'm pretty sure bringing us to shore in our sleep was their hello," says Joshua.

"Didn't know you spoke 'weirdass alien we're not even sure exists'," retorts Joana. Joshua seems ready to retaliate.

"Hey, calm down." Yusuf stands between the two. "Captain says we prepare for the worst, hope for the best, than that's what we do."


"It sent us a message, we send one back," you say. "We make it clear we're not frightened."

"The easiest way to show fear is by presenting some kind of weapon," says Sarah. "I hope that's not what you have in mind."

"Why not? It's clearly showed us its teeth," says Joshua, stepping forward. "And holding a weapon isn't an act of fear. It's an assertion of power, and from power comes safety."

"What the fuck are you on about?" asks Joana. "Weapons? Against something we haven't seen, something we're not even sure is physical in the way we are? I'd like to see you build something to destroy that." Joshua seems ready to retaliate.

"Hey, calm down." Yusuf stands between the two. "Captain says we prepare for the worst, than that's what we do."


[[Anyone else?]]
[[Let's get to it.]]

"Anyone else?" You look around. It's impossible to read Teeneese, but you can see everyone else is uneasy, even Yusuf. But no one says a word. "Good. Let's get to it."

"Let's get to it," you say. It's impossible to read Teeneese, but you can see everyone else is uneasy, even Yusuf.



TASK: LEARN

"Our primary goal is simple: learn everything we can about the lifeforms of this planet. From that understanding, we'll have a better idea if there is a need to be afraid. And if so, we'll know how to defend ourselves. If not, we won't have jeopardized the possibility of peaceful contact." These words, direct and controlled, sound like they're coming from someone else, but you swallow them as your own. "We're all scientists, engineers, explorers. Let's spread out, use those skills to look for biological samples, map out traces of life, and document everything we can about this environment and any biomarkers."


TASK: DEFEND

"Our primary goal is simple: ensure our safety in the next encounter with the lifeforms. We can't assume good intentions, but that doesn't mean they aren't there. But our survival is paramount." These words, direct and controlled, sound like they're coming from someone else, but you swallow them as your own. "We're all scientists, engineers, professionals. Let's spread out, use those skills to collect and process samples of any biological material, map out our environment, and then regroup and develop defensive strategies."



TASK: SEND MESSAGE

"Our primary goal is simple: find those lifeforms, and make contact on our terms, not theirs. Those things are out there, somewhere close. We search for them, find them, and tell them we aren't to be trifled with. We can't assume peaceful intent." These words, direct and controlled, sound like they're coming from someone else, but you swallow them as your own. "We're all scientists, engineers, pioneers. Let's spread out, use those skills to search for any signs of this lifeform, map out the area, and be ready for a confrontation."


"I recommend traveling in pairs," says CINDI. "One drone can accompany each group, highlighting areas of interest, recording and mapping terrain, and if needed provide tactical support."

"I'll go with Joshua," Sarah says quickly. "We should have an even spread of our scientists, paired with engineers and... whatever you do."

"Resource management. It's not that hard to remember," he says.

"I concur, Sarah," replies CINDI. "Each team should have a wide skillset. Captain, would you like Teeneese, our Astrophysicist, or your sister, our planetary scientist, to accompany you?"

[[Teeneese.]]
[[Joana]]

"I'll go with Teeneese," you say.

"I'll go with Joana," you say.

"Excellent," CINDI continues. "I suggest one group goes north along the coast, the other pair south, and the third inland towards the desert. As of yet, I am unsure of how the day-night cycle on this planet operates, but I will keep track of both hours elapsed and the sun's movement."

"We should be sure to meet back here before dark," says Yusuf. "I don't think we should spend the night separated."

"I'd like to stay along the coast," says Sarah. "If there's biosignatures too small for us to see, that's where they'll be germinating."

"I'll... go to the south," says Yusuf, looking down at his compass. "I know it doesn't mean anything, but... this is pointing in that direction."

[[That's a silly way to make a decision.]]
[[Maybe it does mean something.]]

"That's a silly way to make a decision," you say. Yusuf's heart rate seems to spike momentarily on your monitor of the crew.

"I know it's silly, you're right," he says. "But fuck it, good as any direction, right? Teeneese/Joana and I will go that way."


"Maybe it does mean something," you say. Yusuf's heart rate seems to spike momentarily on your monitor of the crew.

"Yeah... maybe it does," he says. "Fuck it, Teeneese/Joana and I will follow the compass. We'll go that way."


"That leaves you and Teeneese/Joana to go into the desert," says CINDI. "In each of your packs, I want to highlight a few items that should prove useful for your task ahead. For scientific tools, Sarah is equipped with sample collection materials, including a portable drill, storage for soil samples, and a mobile lab equipped with acidics to distill organic material. Teeneese has a portable telescope, with an optional solar filter, and a miniaturized supercomputer capable of conducting simulations or processing data on the go. Joana has sample collection materials designed for geologic materials, including rock and ice samples, and an analysis instrument capable of dating the age of said samples. 

Yusuf has an array of electrical and mechanical parts, a portable power source, and a modular micro-drone, capable of deployment if needed. Joshua is equipped with an extensive inventory management system, that will track and organize these instruments as well as any samples collected. An essential task, to be sure.

The Captain/$name (FIND THINGS THAT WILL BE PLOT RELEVANT !!! Maybe direct drone control?)

You are all equipped with a pulse-beam emmiter (come up with something better/less cliche/more thematic), capable of emitting a pulse of energy in both lethal and non-lethal quantities, in addition to the communication devices you are already aware of. (Any questions? -&gt; write q&amp;a here if there's room for more exposition)"

Joshua reaches into a pouch and produces a small white oval, that can fit in the palm of his hand. "This is the gun?"

"That is a crude description of the device, but yes," says CINDI. "That is the gun."

You see a smile flash across Joshua's face from behind the suit, as he puts the device back into the pouch.

"What should we do with these objects?" asks Sarah. "Just... leave them here?"

"Unless you wish to carry a water purifier around with you," says Teeneese.

"I'm taking the compass with me, that's for sure," says Yusuf.

[[You can each make that choice for yourselves.]]
[[If you can, hold onto the objects.]]
[[I recommend leaving them behind.]]

"You can each make that choice for yourselves," you say.

"If you can, hold onto the objects," you say. "Who knows, they may come in handy."

"I recommend leaving them behind," you say. "They could be dangerous."

Yusuf puts his compass in his pocket, and Sarah leaves the water purifier near your telescope. Joshua slings his guitar awkwardly over his back, with the strap attached to it, (did you already say this?) while Teeneese (does something with her object that you need to decide!!!). The group is prepared.

[[Good luck, stay safe.]]
[[Check in every hour.]]
[[No one do anything stupid.]]

"Good luck, stay safe," you tell the group, as you and Teeneese/Joana walk off.

"I recommend every group checking in at least every hour for a status update," says CINDI. "And I reiterate the Captain's words: good luck."


"Check in every hour," you say. "Make sure to keep in contact."

"Good luck," says CINDI. "I will be with every team for support, as will the drones overhead."


"No one do anything stupid," you tell the group, as you and Teeneese/Joana walk off.

"I recommend every group checking in at least every hour for a status update," says CINDI. "And good luck."



Sand is difficult to traverse in low gravity, as you soon found out. Every step sends the shallow dune formations into disarray, floating up over your boots and slowly down, pooling about your heels, until you lift the foot, making it all tumble into the created crevice and so on. The first hour, noticing this pattern is the most noteworthy occurance. The sun has slowly grown higher in the sky. Teeneese/your sister takes some samples of the sand, but other than that, the landscape is no more alien than usual.

"This is Sarah, checking in after our first hour," she says over the suit intercom. "I've collected some wet soil samples from the shore, the (mini-lab) is processing now. I'll update with any noteworthy results, though they'll likely only come in by tomorrow."

Yusuf calls in next. "Not much to report here, either. We've been collecting soil samples as well, Joana is hoping to get a date on them soon. / When we regroup, hopefully Joana can get a date on them. Other than that, it's still a beautiful sunrise on the coast."

[[Sunrise? Seems at least like early morning to me.]]
[[Thanks for the report, everyone.]]
[[Same here, surprisingly nothing out of the ordinary.]]

"Sunrise? Seems at least like early morning to me," you reply, looking at the sun beating down at you from above. You're grateful for the suit's airflow.

"Well, I'm still not clear on where you grew up," quips Yusuf, "but I'm pretty sure what we're looking at is still a sunrise."

"That potential discrepancy is noted," says Teeneese. "We have nothing to report. I've taken samples for analysis as well."

"I look forward to dating those samples, too," says Joana.

OR: "That potential discrepancy is noted," says Teeneese over the comm.

"Well, we've got nothing else to report, being honest," says Joana. "I also took some soil samples I'm trying to date."


"Thanks for the report, everyone," you reply, looking at the sun beating down at you from above. You're grateful for the suit's airflow.

"We have nothing to report," says Teeneese. "Other than that I've taken samples for analysis as well."

OR: "Well, we've got nothing else to report, being honest," says Joana. "I also took some soil samples I'm trying to date."


"Same here, surprisingly nothing out of the ordinary," you reply, looking at the sun beating down at you from above. You're grateful for the suit's airflow.

"We have nothing to report," says Teeneese. "Other than that I've taken samples for analysis as well."

OR: "Well, we've got nothing else to report, being honest," says Joana. "I also took some soil samples I'm trying to date."


"Sounds like that'll be a pretty dry romance," says Joshua, sounding far too proud of himself.

[[Laugh.]]
[[Don't laugh.]]

You chuckle. "I'll let you all know how it goes in an hour."

You don't laugh. Teeneese holds back a small chuckle. It's still pretty awkward. "Well, yeah. Nothing else to report."


The comms go silent, and the walking begins once again. Another hour passes, all you're met with is more sand. The second check in goes like the first, and so does the third. You start to loose track of time. Some hours pass in an instant, others take an eternity. The sun continues to rise. Far in the distance, you start to see hints of a more complex geology. Large sand formations, potentially rock as well. No signs of anything green, anything alive.

[[Send drones to investigate formations.]]
[[Keep walking.]]

"CINDI, can the drone take a closer look at those formations?"

(stuff about the geologic formations)

There's a noticeable increase in heat, as the sun slowly continues to rise. Another hour passes, and Yusuf calls to check in.

"No one else finds it weird the Sun's still at the horizon?" asks Yusuf.

[[It's not at the horizon. It's clearly in the sky.]]
[[If it's still at the horizon for you, then yes.]]

"It's not at the horizon," you say. "It's clearly in the sky."

"If it's still at the horizon for you, then yes," you say. "That would be very weird."

CINDI interjects. "There is the capacity to send visual data across the network connecting the six of you, that may help with this disagreement."

"We've got cameras in these suits? Sweet," says Yusuf. "I think of everything."

A moment later, an image appears on your screen. It's (Teeneese, standing awkwardly besides a rising sun, identical to what you saw this morning.) (Sibling, hands stretched up besides a rising sun, identical to what you saw this morning).

[[We must be... experiencing time differently.]]
[[That's impossible.]]
[[Can anyone explain this?]]

"We must be... experiencing time differently," you say, sending a photo back to Yusuf. "Look, the sun's clearly risen. You must be stuck in some kind of... frozen space in time."

"Don't be ridiculous," says Teeneese. "This planet is tidally locked. It's the simplest explanation."


"That's impossible," you say, sending a photo back to Yusuf. "Look, the sun's positioned completely different here."

"It's clearly not impossible," says Teeneese. "This planet is tidally locked. It's the simplest explanation."


"Can anyone explain this?" you ask, sending a photo back to Yusuf. "Look, the sun's positioned completely different here." 

"This planet is tidally locked. It's the simplest explanation," says Teeneese.

[[That... makes sense.]]
[[What does that mean?]]
[[That can't be right.]]

"That... makes sense," you say.

"Tidally locked? What does that mean?" asks Yusuf. "Even if I did know, I sure as hell don't now."


"What does that mean?" you ask.


"That can't be right," you say.

"What does that even mean?" asks Yusuf. "Even if I used to know, I sure as hell don't now."


"It means this planet's rotation and orbit are locked in so that one side is always facing the sun. From a single spot, the sun will always look the same, like by the shore. But, for anyone moving inland, they're moving further onto the side always facing the sun, so it'll look higher in the sky. We must have landed on the night side of the planet."

"So... there's no day and night?" asks Joshua. "Just, always day and always night?"

"That is correct. It also means this desert will grow extremely hot the further we go, as we move more into the endless sun. And, the further into the dark side of the planet, the colder it will be."

[[Does that sound accurate, CINDI?]]
[[It's a good working hypothesis.]]

"Does that sound accurate, CINDI?"

"Based on current observable data, yes," she replies. "It also makes the shoreline an ideal base of operations, where the temperature should be stable, neither too cold nor warm."

"We should head back soon, the further we go the hotter it'll get," says Joana

(or:) "I recommend returning to the shore, if we go much further we risk overheating," says (Teeneese).

[[You're right, let's head back.]]
[[We should go a bit further.]]

"You're right," you say. "Let's head back."

The two of you turn back, and follow your own footprints in the sand back towards the shore, barely visible on the horizon.


"We should go a bit further," you say.

You push forward, with (Sibling/Teeneese) following behind, towards the rock formations coming out of the sand.


After some time, you notice something before you. As you squint in the distance, you see a dark patch near the base of a steep sand dune, a silhouette of what could be a person. It's sizzling, vibrating so quickly it's difficult to notice. 

"Do you see that?" you ask.

"I see nothing," says Teeneese. / "See what?" asks Joana. "There's nothing there."

[[There's some humanoid figure.]]
[[It must be... nothing.]]

"There's some humanoid figure," you say. "By that sand dune."

Even as the words leave your mouth, you blink and its gone.

"There is nothing there, $name/Captain." / "Are you feeling okay?"

[[I know what I saw.]]
[[It must be... nothing.]]

"I know what I saw."

"It must be... nothing.

The both of you continue in the heat. You know an hour passes, but only because the others call to check in. You think you see the figure again, on some occasions. But then it materializes clearly before you, a dozen feet from where you stand. Its form doesn't move, but the material making it up flows and shifts. You can't get a good look before it sprints off to your right.

[[Go back to the shore.]]
[[Run after it.]]

(WRITE ANOTHER PATH THAT DOESNT INVOLVE RUNNING TOWARDS IT)

Shore:

(if already going there:) You don't follow it, and continue walking to shore more quickly than you were.

"What's the hurry?"



Again. It appears in front of you.




Run:

You move as fast as you can in the sand, in the suit, in the air like molasses, running running lunging to approach the figure. It appears further off each time you blink. The sun is higher in the sky, its warmth and radiation raining down on you, the cooling systems of the suit can only do so much. The figure simmers in the distance. The thought comes across your mind it could be a mirage, but you dispel that. It's real. Too much has happened for this to be imagination.

You blink, and it's gone. Reappeared closer, to your right. You turn, making gains on the figure. Your breathing grows heavier, your heart rate faster. Several menacing beeps emit from your suit.

"I recommend slowing down your pace, especially in this heat," says CINDI. "These suits were not designed for this kind of exertion in this environment."

You continue, your steps turning into small jumps, heightened from the low gravity. After one of these, your foot catches the sand as you fall back, pushing your body softly into the sand. You see the bottom half of the figure steps in front of you.

"$name/Captain, you are suffering from extreme rates of heat exhaustion," her voice is more urgent than its ever been. "Please return to the shore. You must move to the shore. Please return to the shore."

Each blink seems to last longer than the last as you drag and float yourself forward towards the figure's feet.

[[Touch it.]]
[[Don't touch it.]]

You reach out, and touch the figure's foot. Even through the shielding of the suit, it's freezing. Slowly, you look up, as the shadowy figure begins to materialize. Legs, torso transforming into a jumpsuit much like the one you wore beneath the (exo?)suit. When you see the figure's face, instantly you know who it is. The mirage is of your mother.

Your hand is stretched out, but ultimately sits down onto the sandy surface. The figure's foot moves, toes up, heel moving towards your hand. Ink blotting the air as it streaks toward you, heel on the ground, foot falling over your fingers. Even through the shielding of the suit, it's freezing. But there was little force, it doesn't hurt. Slowly, you look up, as the shadowy figure begins to materialize. Legs, torso transforming into a jumpsuit much like the one you wore beneath the (exo?)suit. When you see the figure's face, instantly you know who it is. The mirage is of your mother.

Everything goes black. As unconsciousness grips you, CINDI's echos trickle into silence. "You must move to the shore. Please return to shore. You must move to the shore..."</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="847" name="Dream 2" tags="" position="85360,160">Boarding ship?

Joshua (LN) couldn't stop adjusting the synthetic tablecloth draped over the cold metallic table, hoping some adjustment could bring the warmth he had imagined it to have in his mind. The low, yellow and orange lighting could trick someone into thinking a fire was burning nearby for a moment, but not much more.

(choose / add music, mention wine / food)

But the view could not be more brilliant. Joshua had plotted Enceladus' orbit so Saturn and its rings would sit just outside the window on this very evening. The rings streaked across the sky and the stars and the gas giant behind them as if there was some kind of splinter in the fabric of the universe, through this perfect gold shined through. Joshua knew it was just rock and ice, refracted light, but that almost made it all the more impossibly perfect.

There's a harsh ring. "Your guest has arrived," says a deep voice, in a British accent.

[[Turn to greet him.]]
[[Keep looking at the window.]]

"Let him in." You turn to see the doors shift apart, and Elliot (LAST NAME) walk through, oval spectacles and a thick woolen sweater. He looks around, at the table and tablecloth, the lighting, the view. And the music.

"Let him in." You stare ahead at the cosmos before you as you hear the doors shift apart, and a pair of light footsteps approach you from behind. Elliot (LAST NAME) arrives at your left, wearing a thick woolen sweater, Saturn reflected in his oval spectacles.

"Oh, this is lovely." His smile splinters across his face.

[[I've got to use my perks for something.]]
[[Not as lovely as you.]]

"I've got to use my perks for something." Joshua pulls back one of the seats, by the window.

Elliot looks down at it. His mouth opens, searching for words. "This is... it's all too much."


"Not as lovely as you." Joshua pulls back one of the seats, by the window.

"Please, don't say things like that." Elliot looks down at the seat. His mouth opens, searching for words. "This is... it's all too much."

[[Just indulge me.]]
[[I know you enjoy the extravagance.]]

"Just indulge me. Please." The music is quiet in the background, filling the silences between words.

"I'll try to enjoy myself. As a favor." Elliot takes the seat.


"I know you enjoy the extravagance." The music is quiet in the background, filling the silences between words.

"I can't hide anything from you, can I?" Elliot takes the seat.


Joshua walks around to the other side of the small table and takes his own. Before each of them was a (figure out how food works describe here), and a long flask.

"What's in the bottle?" asks Elliot.

[[Red wine.]]
[[A surprise.]]


"A very special wine. Pinot noir, 2035. California. The storage unit has a small centrifuge that rotates the liquid, keeping it perfectly stable at Earth's gravity."

Joshua connected the flask to the smaller glass container on Elliot's side of the table through a small tube. A dark emerald red liquid churns through.

Elliot's eyes are wide. "I can't begin to imagine what this cost..."

[[Then don't.]]
[[Just taste it.]]


"A surprise." Joshua connected the flask to the smaller glass container on Elliot's side of the table through a small tube. A dark emerald red liquid churns through.

"That's not..." Elliot's eyes are wide. "I can't begin to imagine what this cost..."

[[Then don't.]]
[[Just taste it.]]

"Then don't." 

"Just taste it."

He pours himself a glass, the liquid floating inside the sealed container. Joshua raises his glass to Elliot, who slowly does the same. They both put their lips to the seal, opening the container allowing the liquid to be sucked in.

Elliot's face is one of immediate revulsion, then a smile and laughter. "Oh, god. It's disgusting!"

[[Sip it again.]]
[[You don't like it?]]

"Sip it again." Joshua puts down his glass, watching Elliot intently.

He slowly lifts the glass to his lips again, sipping slowly. "Better?" asks Joshua.

Elliot considers for a moment. "Better," he says.


"You don't like it?" Joshua puts down his glass, watching Elliot intently.

He slowly lifts the glass to his lips again, sipping slowly.

Elliot considers for a moment. "It could... grow on me."


The slow music and the flowing wine and the vista all swirled into a warmth that they each began to feel somewhere between them, a gravitational well neither could escape.

It was an evening without morning in a place without time. Neither could say how much time had passed before Elliot asked Joshua to dance.

"Dance?" Joshua recoiled at the question. "I don't know how. I'm sorry."

"I haven't the faintest idea how to drink wine, but I suffered through that fortune of a glass, and now I feel giddy enough to ask you to dance. Which is a surprise, even for me. The opportunity may not come again in a melenia. So, I ask again: will you dance with me?"

Joshua closes his eyes. "How can I say no?" He smiles, opening them, and stands.

Elliot gently reaches out to his fingers, pulling him close. Joshua's back straightens as Elliot stretches his hand around him, letting it rest at the small of his back. The other hand rests loosely to their side. Joshua's spare hand ambles from back to hip and comes to rest up on Elliot's shoulder.

"See, not too scary, is it?"

[[We haven't started moving yet.]]
[[I'm already petrified.]]

"We haven't started moving yet."

"I'm already petrified."

The movement begins with a jolt but immediately falls into a rhythm, as Elliot leads Josh back and forth in tune with the music.

[[This isn't so bad.]]
[[I'm so bad at this.]]

"This isn't so bad."





It would be impossible for either of the two boys to say how long they were in that room together. Had either of them asked CINDI, she would tell them it was about four hours and thirty seven minutes, but neither ever did. 

"I wish this room could be forever." It was a whisper in Josh's ear.

[[Maybe it can.]]
[[Not this room, but somewhere could be.]]

"Maybe it can." Josh stares out to Saturn's rings as his chin rests on Elliot's shoulder.

"Not this room, but somewhere could be." Josh stares out to Saturn's rings as his chin rests on Elliot's shoulder.

"Would you go? To Proxima b, if we ever find a way to get there?"

[[










"Would you go? To Proxima b, if there was a ship?"

"Alone? Or with you?"

"Are the answers different?"

"Opposite, in fact. With you? I'd go and never give a second thought to coming back."

"Then I promise you. If we ever go there, we both have one-way tickets."






"Take them off." There's a glint in his eye, Joshua thinks. Or perhaps it's a star reflected in his spectacles. "I've never fathomed why we use them. It's all this... pretending we're somewhere we're not."


He slips them off, revealing small and pale toes. The socks stick to the ground as he begins to float upwards.

"I like this better. 



Dance (or not?)


Then talk about wanting to run away, hint towards that.

End with some cute shit. But it's sad bc we know he's dead.

Amarizio / Ana dynamic
Joana very young, you're not born (Ana is pregnant?)
Whose there? Joana, Ana, Issac, Amarizio



It was the first thing Joana could remember. Laughter, at wildly varying pitches. The strange hum of low, warm light. Coming from what were usually emergency lights, some red and others yellow, hooked onto the weak stringy leaves of a tomato plant. Bulbous fruits hanging down. Packages underneath. A strange welling up of excitement in her stomach.

It's Christmas, and she's never seen her uncle smile so much, mother laugh so much, father eat so much.

"An old man would like his time to speak!" Uncle Amarizio bangs together a hard plastic cup and spoon to get everyone's attention.

Ana Dandara points out he's not that old. There's laughter. "In that case, this middle-aged man, with wisdom beyond his years, would like to speak."

Joana wants to be part of the laughter too. Use the words she's just now beginning to grapple with.

[[You're old, Uncle! Don't listen to Mom.]]
[[








Joana sees her Mom and Uncle walk out to the clearing, and she follows. Light cascades down from a hole far above them, covered by class. She sees dust being blown across it.

"Zio, she didn't send us here just to come back." Joana would come to recognize this exasperated tone in her mother's voice, often directed at her, or later at you. Before you both left.

"Earth is my home. Even as its dying... I feel the need to come back." That burning sincerity in Amarizio's voice, that sound still plays in Joana's mind when she is unsure of what step to take next. "It's not right, us being here. As one half of the world burns, the other freezes. I think about Bahia, buried in snow. Our home."

"It's not my home." This is sharper. "Zio--"

"That's not my name," he snaps. "That's my name for people who don't want to use my name."

"-- I left Earth before I could do algebra. You had a childhood there, before it all changed. I didn't. There's nothing for me to go back to. And there's nothing for you to go back to."

"There won't be if you and Issac follow ProXima to the end of the galaxy. But if you talked to him, convinced him to--"

"Throwing money at a dead planet won't save it. No research can change the inevitable. Plus, we're spending more on the climate control technology than even on the Saturn project. This is--"

"It's fucked. And you know it." Joana had only heard that word once before, but knows its bad. "Whose Issac to decide... any of this?"

"You know it's not what he wants. His mother--"

"-- is dead. And he has the company she forged out of her billions. I don't care what he wants. There's too much at stake for that to matter."

They've stopped fidgeting the way they always do, Amarizio opening and closing his fists, Ana Dandara pacing. Now they stood still, staring at one another.

"He's my husband. I only care about we want."

"So. Let the old world burn, so you can gallivant through the stars, is that it?"

"The old world is what we carry with us. Forward." Mom had a fire that could come out, too. But it was different, hers more urgent. "Our job is to find a place for as many of us as we can to land. Earth only has to last long enough for us to leave it."

"Please don't tell me you think you're saving the human race, by falling in love with the richest CEO humankind has ever known, and setting up resorts from Venus to Saturn."

"It's Christmas, Amarizio. If someone ever did once die on a cross for our sins, then find it in yourself to forgive me for finding the happiness you never could. 

But pretending to be a bitter old man


"This family gives me all the love and joy I need. I'm sorry you can't see that. I'm sorry you always have felt a need for a purpose greater than that, than protecting what we already have.





"What are you doing here, Jo?" Mom kneels down to hold your hand.

[[You're late for presents.]]
[[I don't want you to be mad with Uncle.]]

Before you enter, you hesitate.

[[Knock.]]
[[Ask if he's there.]]
[[Go in.]]

You knock. The silence remains. / Again, silence.

[[Ask if he's there.]]
[[Go in.]]

"Dad?" you call out. "Are you in there?" The silence remains. / Again, silence.

[[Ask CINDI for Issac's location.]]
[[Go in.]]

"CINDI, where is the location of Issac Alexander?"

The voice responds, from a wall panel. "Issac Alexander is on Cassini Station*, in his laboratory. He is X meters in front of you."

You walk through the door, and it slides upwards, letting you into the lab. You've been here many times before, but never like this. The central table is occupied by a massive device. You count at least six power sources connected to it by frayed wiring. Several beakers have been inserted to one side of it, and several others lie broken, oozing liquid dripping from the device, to the table, and painfully slowly to the floor. You watch, as one droplet garners enough force from the moon's gravity to break from the static connection with the table. It moves in a straight line, down. But it takes its time. For a coloniazable body, Enceladus is fairly low in mass, and thus gravitational pool. A droplet of primordial ooze, even compared to that, is nothing at all. The drop did not fall quickly. Instead, it lingered, like a tear that cannot be wiped away, and fell, as you noticed the rest of the scene.

These broken beakers littered the room, the ooze decorating much of the surfaces. Something happened, that was clear. But now, all was silence. You almost didn't notice the back of your father's head as he sat in a chair, without moving a muscle. Barely breathing.

[[Walk around to see his front.]]
[[Ask him what's going on.]]
[[Grab his shoulder.]]

You walk around the lab, so you can see what he looks like from the front. His eyes hang open loosely, darting from one place to the next, and his mouth is slightly ajar.

"What... is all this?" you ask on deaf ears. He doesn't even twitch.

You reach out, and touch your father's shoulders. It's cold as burning ice, and you pull back your finger immediately. The sting echos on your fingertips for some time.

(after 2 of the above:)

This has never happened before. Father was always moving, speaking, thinking. This silence and stillness didn't look like death, it was something worse.

[[Call for help.]]
[[Sit with him.]] 

"CINDI, get help," you say.

"Certainly. I will alert the station's emergency medical staff immediately. And send a message to your mother."

[[Thank you.]]
[[Don't message her.]]

"Thank you." The silence returns. You find a place to sit.


"Don't message her," you say. "Not yet."

You wonder where she is, what she's doing. How long it would take her to spring into action and find you both, here. "Very well. I will not bother her." You find a place to sit.


You pull a clean chair out from under a lab table, place it across from Issac, and sit. His eyes keep darting in silence, zooming across the room. Their light blue almost seemed to glow in the low light of the lab. You try and catch the eyes as they move about the room, crossing your path occasionally. They begin to move slower, each time. Coming back to move past you. Issac's lower lip begins to tremble.

[[I'm here, dad.]]
[[Say nothing.]]

"I'm here, dad." His eyes slow to a stop. Resting when their pointed towards you.

You say nothing, keeping your eyes locked towards your father. His eyes slow to a stop. Resting when their pointed towards you.

He blinks. Once. Then again, a few times, rapidly. He closes his mouth, and turns. He sees the laboratory in disarray, the flasks broken, sample materials everywhere. Tears stream down his face. The water trickles with minimal sounds, as he contains his whimpering.

[[What's wrong?]]
[[You need help.]]

"What's wrong?" He looks back at you. Locking his eyes onto yours, as if only now he noticed you were actually there.

"Of course everything's wrong," he says, as if this were obvious. "That's not the question. The question is what's right."

[[What's right, then?]]
[[You're not making any sense.]]

"What's right, then?"

"Nothing. Right now I think the only thing that's right is nothing." His eyes dart up, look from side to side. "I'm sorry, it's hard to hear with all the noise."


"You need help." He looks back at you. Locking his eyes onto yours, as if only now he noticed you were actually there.

"Of course I need help," he says as if this were obvious. "All of us need help. We forget that. It leads us away from the best path."

[[What is the best path?]]
[[You're not making any sense.]]

"What is this?"

"Nothing. Right now I think the best path is nothing." His eyes dart up, look from side to side. "I'm sorry, it's hard to hear with all the noise."


"You're not making any sense."

"I don't thing I ever made sense. I don't think sense is what I'm trying to make." His eyes dart up, look from side to side. "I'm sorry, it's hard to hear with all the noise."

You listen, for a moment. There's not a sound.

[[There's no noise.]]
[[It's okay, you're hearing me fine.]]

"There's no noise."

"You, can't hear it, can you? That's... okay. That's fine. But I do need you to listen to me."


"It's okay, you're hearing me fine."

"Okay. But are you hearing me? I need you to. I need you to listen to me."


[[I'm listening.]]
[[I'm scared.]]

"I'm listening."

"Good. It's... like squeezing something flat. For them. That's why we have to stop. Why we can't ever, ever use it. I can't-- it hurt, to hear all this. To feel all this. I don't want to hurt you."

"I'm scared."

"You have every right to be. It is scary. For them as much as for us. More for them, I think. It's... like squeezing something flat. For them. That's why we have to stop. Why we can't ever, ever use it. I can't-- it hurt, to hear all this. To feel all this. I don't want to hurt you."

[[You're not going to hurt me.]]
[[Then don't.]]

"You're not going to hurt me."

"I won't. But I could." He looks down. "Blinding. It's all so blinding. They give hands to build, don't tell you they're fists. Give you machines, don't tell you they're slaves. Give you... toys, don't tell you they're..."


"Then don't."

"I will. But only because I can't stop it." He looks down. "Blinding. It's all so blinding. They give hands to build, don't tell you they're fists. Give you machines, don't tell you they're slaves. Give you... toys, don't tell you they're..."

It's as if he hit a snag in his thoughts.

"Is anyone coming? Anyone else?" Now, panic in his eyes. Wider than you'd ever seen them.

[[Yes.]]
[[No.]]

"Yes."

"Then I'll speak quickly." Eyes narrow, head hunches. "The fuel. It can hurt." He gives a small nod. "It can hurt."


"No."

"Good. Good." Eyes soften, head lifts. "This device, that I've been working on... there's something you need to know about it. I can't... exactly explain it, but I know, very deeply, it is true. The fuel, it--"


(if no one is coming)

Issac seems to be at a loss for words.

[[It's okay, take your time.]]
[[What about the fuel?]]
[[I'm calling for help. You're sick.]]

"It's okay, take your time."

"Thank you." He takes a breath. "The fuel. The microbes. They feel pain. They hurt. And they-- there's so much more than that. We cannot use them like this. I know we cannot. There is no reason to justify the use of what I have created."


"What about the fuel?"

"The fuel. The microbes. They feel pain. They hurt. And they-- there's so much more than that. We cannot use them like this. I know we cannot. There is no reason to justify the use of what I have created."

[[We have to use them.]]
[[I'm calling for help. You're sick.]]
[[I don't understand, but I'm trying to.]]

"We have to use them." Issac's eyes grow smaller. "There's too much at stake, and you don't know what you're saying."

"I know exactly what I am saying. This is life, and this device squashes it."

[[They are bacteria. It isn't the same.]]
[[How do you know all of this? Why now?]]
[[I don't understand, but I'm trying to.]]

"They are bacteria. It isn't the same."

"If there are gods, wouldn't they say the same as us?"


"How do you know all this? Why now?"

"There's... something in my head. Not something. Pieces of the microorganism. Whatever was... left. After testing the engine. And it's... trying to talk to me. Scream at me. Tell me what I've done. Begging me to never do it again."


[[I'm calling for help. You're sick.]]
[[I don't understand, but I'm trying to.]]


"I'm calling for help. You're sick."

"We're all sick.

"CINDI, get him help," you say.

"Certainly. I will alert the station's emergency medical staff immediately. And send a message to your mother."

"You didn't have to do that." 


"I don't understand, but I'm trying to."

"Thats... all I need. It's all I'm doing, too. Understand. It's a simple word. A simple start."

(move to Ana's entrance)



(when medical + Ana arrive)

The nearly silent whoosh of the door cuts through the scene. You turn to see Ana Dandara with two members of station security, and medical personnel. She immediately turns her attention to the broken test tubes and material spread throughout the room.

"This laboratory is under a high-security lockdown until further notice," she says to the security officers. "Everyone who has made contact with the environment must be quarantined."

The medical professionals pull up masks and move towards Issac. His eyes scream fear.

"I just need to speak. I don't need quarantine." As he is pulled up by his arms, it looks as if every joint in his body is breaking out of a stiff, frozen sleep. "Let me finish talking to my son. Let me talk to my wife."

"We need to get you help, before anything else. We can talk soon." Ana keeps her distance, still under the door's threshold.

They take Issac out of the room. He attempts to struggle, but his body is moving too slowly, too haphazardly to be effective. Even so, one of the doctors injects him with something that turns his body limp. He's placed on a stretcher in the hallway.

Ana looks at him, lying there, and then turns to you. "Did you touch anything?"

[[Yes.]]
[[No.]]
[[I can't remember.]]

"Yes." (if you did:) You feel the singe of your father's skin still on your hand.

Ana turns to one of the other doctors, and nods her head in your direction. They approach you with the same injection they gave Issac. In a moment, the world melts away.


"No." (if you did:) You feel the singe of your father's skin still on your hand.

Ana lets out a small smile, and nods for you to follow her as she leaves the room. You step out, and the door closes behind you with an extra click. As you walk away, the two members of station security left to guard the door stare straight ahead.


"I can't remember."

(if good relationship:) Ana lets out a small smile, and nods for you to follow her as she leaves the room. You step out, and the door closes behind you with an extra click. As you walk away, the two members of station security left to guard the door stare straight ahead.

(if bad relationship:) Ana turns to one of the other doctors, and nods her head in your direction. They approach you with the same injection they gave Issac. In a moment, the world melts away.







(if just medical is coming) (eh probably cut this have ana always come)















From behind you, the sound of the door opens.




"Everything... it's... it's... 




(dialoge and responses)

He turns, locking his eyes onto yours, as if only now he noticed you were actually there. "$name. Oh, good. You have to know, $name. It's-- not fuel. We can't use them as fuel. They told me so, no fuel. That's what they said. And... pain. I cannot begin to use words."

[[You're not making any sense.]]
[[What's not fuel?]]
[[Pain? What hurt you?]]





Try and get a bit of cryptic stuff, then security arrives





The nearly silent whoosh of the door cuts through the scene. You turn to see Ana Dandara with two members of station security. Ana's face exudes

"This labratory needs to be on a high-security lockdown until prior notice. Immediately. And all personel that have made contact with lab materials must be quarantined 


She comes up to you. "Did you touch anything?"

[[Yes.]]
[[No.]]
[[I can't remember.]]



PUT a lockdwon, player may or may not have made contact. May or may not have quarantined. These choices can be come back to to potentially spread the microbe everywhere.



Scene ends: etiher you in quarantine; or pushed away after dad's in quarantine
(either way, watch the walk from lab to quarantine)


L- l- listen to me. This is v-very. It's important. 




































"Solmente e um bichinho," she says.

"Porque um bichinho nao e importante?" the little girl responds. "Nao estou falando que nois precisa salvar todos os bichinos nesse praia, mais para olhar antes de colocar seu pe no chao nao e dificil."

"Ta certo," ela fala. "Voce ta completamente certo. Vem aqui."

As ondas da praia vem e vem de novo, trazendo mais bichinhos e returnando outros para o oceano.


"It's just a sand crab," she says.

"And why isn't a sandcrab important?" the little girl responds. "I'm not saying we need to save every little creature on this beach, but to look before you put down your foot isn't difficult."

"You're right," she says. "You're completely right. Come here."

The waves of the beach come and come again, bringing more creatures to shore and returning others to the ocean.





She blinks. You almost hear the fading sounds of the waves</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="856" name="Memory Switch" tags="" position="86460,160">Ana Dandara stands next to her husbands telescope, looking out from the station's observational deck to the cascading geysers beyond. Her right hand rested on the scope's shaft, an almost empty cannister of champagne in the other.

She hears steps behind her. "I thought I might find you here." The voice is smooth.

[[You know me better than you let on.]]
[[I wish you'd leave me alone.]]

"You know me better than you let on." She turns, finding Ezra (?) carrying two full containers of the golden liquid.

"But humble enough to know I have much to learn." He offers Ana one of the drinks.


"I wish you'd leave me alone." She turns, finding Ezra (?) carrying two full containers of the golden liquid.

"Then I'd have to drink both of these all by myself." He offers Ana one of the drinks.

[[Take the drink.]]
[[Refuse the drink.]]

She finishes the cannister in her hand, and takes the offering from Ezra. The bubbles seem to scorch her throat, and she wonders what magic had to happen to keep the beverage fresh for the long journey here.

She shakes her head, turning down the drink, finishing her own instead. The bubbles seem to scorch her throat, and she wonders what magic had to happen to keep the beverage fresh for the long journey here.


He walks up beside Ana, and the telescope. "I wanted to give my condolences. About your husband."

[[If you cared, you'd delay the launch.]]
[[Thank you for coming.]]

"If you cared, you'd delay the launch." Ana looks for the blue dot in the sky that Issac could always find.

"We've been over this. Not wasting my breath again." 


"Thank you for coming." Ana looks for the blue dot in the sky that Issac could always find.

"Of course. I'm really not as rude as all that."

There's one spot of light that looks as if it could be the right tint. Maybe that was Earth. Ana lets go of her empty glass, now floating in the air, and walks closer to the glass. Her fingers drag along the edge of the telescope, up until they hit the lens, and fall back to her side.

Water congeals at the edges of her eyes.

[[Wipe them away.]]
[[Leave them.]]

Ana takes the back of her hand, and wipes them away.

The salty liquid rests there, pooling as more drizzles forth quietly. Still as the snow stuck in the air outside.

"You're strong. You did the right thing," says Ezra as he walks up next to her. "That pain you're feeling, it's the burden of people like you and me to bear. For those who can't."

[[And what's so special about people like us?]]
[[Or that's the lie to help us sleep at night.]]

"And what's so special about people like us?"

"Our pain is a sacrifice... towards something greater." He turns to Ana. "You knew what had to happen. So, you dealt with the situation. This is all... so much more than any one of us. Issac knew that. But, it hurts. Always does. But that's just... a drop in a pond."


"Or that's the lie to help us sleep at night."

"Does it matter? What we're doing is right. If I can save humanity and be well rested too, well. I'll take that deal."

[[$name already knows.]]
[[At least the secret's safe.]]

"$name already knows." Ana thought about you, back at the reception. The two of you hadn't spoken since you were released from quarantine. But Ana was certain you knew exactly what happened to Issac, and knew there would be no forgiveness.

"Oh, I'm aware. A contingency plan is already in place."


"At least the secret's safe."

"Oh, yes. It will be safe. I know she/he/they know. But it's alright, a contingency plan is already in place." Ana thought about you, back at the reception. The two of you hadn't spoken since you were released from quarantine. / The two of you hadn't spoken since Issac went into quarantine. But Ana was certain you knew exactly what happened to Issac/him, and knew there would be no forgiveness.


[[I don't want to know about it.]]
[[Tell me about this plan.]]

"I don't want to know about it."

"Well, too bad. I came in here to mourn the husband you killed, which is a real downer." He takes a long sip of his drink, then lets go of the cannister, leaving it to float nearby. "So you're going to listen when I tell you how to fix this mess you made. Might even thank me after."

"Tell me about this plan."

He takes a long sip of his drink, then lets go of the cannister, leaving it to float nearby.

"Memory alteration. During cryo. It's simple, a tested technology. Known to help patients with really bad PTSD, stuff like that. People who have shit they want to forget. For us, it's simple. All that needs to be tweaked is any memories that indicate the microbes have any degree of intelligence, and anything with Issac in his later stages."

Ana notices that amid the hand gestures he uses to explain the concept, his fingers are shaking slightly.

"CINDI's already scanning through the crew's memory systems to pinpoint those moments. That data is sent to a neurologist, who identifies the neurons that need to be altered. And, when everyone's in cryo, a special addition to the sleepers takes care of the rest."

He looks at the telescope, starts idly fiddling with it. The optical tube squeaking as its moved back and forth.

"Oh, and then CINDI deletes any record of having done it at all. Good as new. Our colonists arrive with no qualms about the samples they're collecting and the mission goes forth as planned."

The squeaking stops as Ezra picks up his drink, letting the telescope rest.

[[Why are you telling me this?]]
[[That's illegal. I'm not okay with it.]]
[[It's a good plan. As long as nothing goes wrong.]]

"Why are you telling me this?" Ana tries to remember where the telescope was pointed, before. Where Issac was looking the last time he left it.

"Because I want to offer you a spot on the trip. I want to give you a chance to forget."


"That's illegal. I'm not okay with it." Ana tries to remember where the telescope was pointed, before. Where Issac was looking the last time he left it.

"Both those points are irrelevant. The only question you need to answer is whether you want a spot on the trip. Whether you want a chance to forget."


"It's a good plan. As long as nothing goes wrong." Ana tries to remember where the telescope was pointed, before. Where Issac was looking the last time he left it.

"It gets better. I'm offering you a spot on the trip. I'm offering you a chance to forget."

[[What happens if I say no?]]
[[What happens if I say yes?]]


"What happens if I say no?" She asks the question quietly.

"You're the last loose end, sweetheart. Just say yes." He smiles disarmingly. "It's easy. I assign you to the mission, you go down for the long sleep, and when you wake up, you'll remember your husbands death as natural and peaceful. Everyone knows the microbes are just harmless fuel. All is as its meant to be."


"What happens if I say yes?" She asks the question quietly.

"I put you on a last minute assignment to the expedition. Maybe people are pissed, but they'll swallow the news quickly. You go down for the long sleep, and when you wake up, you'll remember your husbands death as natural and peaceful. Everyone knows the microbes are just harmless fuel. All is as its meant to be."

Glancing behind her, Ana sees two members of Proxima's security team. Dressed in appropriate attire for the event, but she recognize them nonetheless. Josiah's seem dull. Ana can sense his pain, but his acceptance as well. He's forgiven himself, for whatever may come. (cut most of this, make subtle, communicate in other ways)

"So. What do you say?"

[[Yes.]]
[[No.]]

"Yes." His eyes brighten, he seems lighter.

"Good. That's... very good to hear." He grabs his drink from the air, and walks swiftly back towards the reception. Ana is left under the dome, looking up to the stars.


"No." His eyes harden, jaw becomes more pronounced.

"Wrong answer." The words slip out like smoke. There's a nod, and Ana hear two sets of feet approach from behind. Josiah closes his eyes as Ana feels something injected at the back of her neck, and then there's darkness.

("Pale Blue Dot from Mars" image)
(ADD: telescope is somewhere in the room, maybe that's what we use.)

Ana Dandara cradled you, standing by a large window pane aboard the Cronus. All the travelers had boarded the ship, each saying their goodbyes before two years of sleep. Mars sat what looked like above them, the red rock that had been their home. Ana couldn't even see the colony from here. The planet looked the same as it had in those first images taken from flyby probes a century ago: naked and new, dead and timeless. Sitting amongst a profound silence. Ana Dandara thought of the miracle of your birth, how this place would hold the markers of that profound joy. Thought of how once the doctors were done with you, she cradled you not to differently to how she did now, but for the first time, thought of how she was one of the first mothers to hold a Martian in her arms.

Issac stood behind, preparing their sleepers for their trip. Ana asked him, without turning, "Do you think he'll/she'll/they'll remember?"

"Remember what?" asked Issac, not turning his head.

"Anything of this place," she replied. "Those barren rocks contain so much of me."

"We can hope," Issac turned. "Sometimes, I try to reach back and gather images from Earth. Not the ones from films or images, but my own. But I only come up with... snippets, single frames of memory. I'm not even sure they're real." Issac walked to join you at the window. "What do you remember?"

Ana looked down into your eyes as they shifted from her face to the window to the corners of the room. This was the first time you experienced weightlessness. Your parents had prepared a sedative for what they thought would be inevitable tears. But, they never came.

[[I can't remember anything.]]
[[An ocean.]]
[[A forest.]]
[[Snow.]]

"I can't remember... anything." She spoke with a softness. You squirmed in her arms, confused. She never could imagine the stories her mother used to tell about Earth. She would always tell Ana about the inn she ran by a beach on the coast of Brazil. Ana thought about the stories her mother didn't tell, about what happened when the seas began to rise. About what they had to do to get on the ship to Mars. The stories she never had to tell, that Ana found as shards in offhand phrases and empty stares.

Issac turned back from the sleepers, looking past Ana and to the window. "That's Earth, isn't it?"

"Where?" Ana looked out, for a dot a bit more blue than the rest, but found nothing. But Issac was the stargazer, not her.


"I remember... an ocean. Sand between my toes and my skin soaking in the sun..." Ana thought about the stories her mother to tell, about the inn she ran by a beach on the coast of Brazil. Ana thought about the stories her mother didn't tell, about what happened when the seas began to rise. About what they had to do to get on the ship to Mars. The stories she never had to tell, that Ana found as shards in offhand phrases and empty stares. But the only memory she had was of the sand and warmth, and the rhythmic water flowing in and out in waves. 

"That ocean's out there, somewhere." Issac turned back from the sleepers, looking past Ana and to the window. "That's Earth, isn't it?"

"Where?" Ana looked out, for a dot a bit more blue than the rest, but found nothing. But Issac was the stargazer, not her.


"I remember... a forest. The tall stalks of trees, the light speckling the floor." Ana remembered being scared, lost. Once, she asked her mother about the time she got lost in the forest, but she didn't remember. Instead, she'd tell Ana about the inn she ran by a beach on the coast of Brazil, admist those same trees. Ana thought about the stories her mother didn't tell, about what happened when the seas began to rise. About what they had to do to get on the ship to Mars. The stories she never had to tell, that Ana found as shards in offhand phrases and empty stares. But the only memory she had was that afternoon, lost amongst the trees and brush.

"Those trees are still there, somewhere." Issac turned back from the sleepers, looking past Ana and to the window. "That's Earth, isn't it?"

"Where?" Ana looked out, for a dot a bit more blue than the rest, but found nothing. But Issac was the stargazer, not her.


"I remember... snow. How fierce my mother held my hand as she looked up and we watched. I thought the stars were falling out of the sky." Ana remembered how her bones felt frozen as the chill settled in. She never asked her mother about that moment, the beginning of the end. Instead, Ana just listened as she'd tell her about the inn she ran by a beach on the coast of Brazil, admist those same trees. Ana thought about the stories her mother didn't tell, about what happened when the seas began to rise. About what they had to do to get on the ship to Mars. The stories she never had to tell, that Ana found as shards in offhand phrases and empty stares. But the only memory she had was of those snowflakes flickering down towards the Earth, too soft to be menacing.

"It's snowing out there, somewhere, I'm sure." Issac turned back from the sleepers, looking past Ana and to the window. "That's Earth, isn't it?"

"Where?" Ana looked out, for a dot a bit more blue than the rest, but found nothing. But Issac was the stargazer, not her.


He came to the window, putting his arm around Ana and pointed. "There, I think. We should make sure the little one gets a good look."

Ana lifted you up a bit higher, bringing you to the window. Your eyes were wide.

[[That's our home. We'll be back, some day.]]
[[That's the world we're leaving behind.]]
[[That's where your mom was born.]]

"That's our home." Ana looked into your eyes, the stars reflected back. "We'll be back, some day."

"Earth, the one and only," added Issac with a strained smile. You gnawed at one of your fingers. Ana gave you a kiss, and whispered in your ear.

"That's the world we're leaving behind." Ana looked into your eyes, the stars reflected back.

"Earth, the one and only," added Issac with a strained smile. You gnawed at one of your fingers. Ana gave you a kiss, and whispered in your ear.

"That's where your mom was born." Ana looked into your eyes, the stars reflected back. "And dad," Issac added with a smile.

[[Don't forget it.]]
[[Don't look back.]]

"Don't forget it." The sounds seeped into your mind, even though you didn't quite know the words.

"Don't look back." The sounds seeped into your mind, even though you didn't quite know the words.




Issac wrapped his arms around you and your mother as the three of you absorbed the last images of the Martian surface. The last glimpses of that bluish dot, getting lost within the stars. "Ana, it's time."

[[I know.]]
[[Just a minute more.]]

"I know," she said. Issac's arms melted down as the moment melted too, and all that was left were the last minute safety checks and entering the cryogenic sleeping chambers and then two years of dreamless sleep.

"Just a minute more." The moment lingered. Ana held you as Issac held you both and even in the mechanical cold of the machine the three of you were contained in, there was warmth. Then, Issac's arms melted down as the moment melted too, and all that was left were the last minute safety checks and entering the cryogenic sleeping chambers and then two years of dreamless sleep.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="858" name="memories to write" tags="" position="86660,160">Def:
